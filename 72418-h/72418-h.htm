<p class="center p160">Preface</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> aeroplane is man’s latest invention. Through it man has
become lord of the air. The steamship and steam engine
had already given him victory over sea and land. Now he is
complete master of the situation.</p>

<p>One of the most delightful uses of the aeroplane is in sightseeing.
Aerial tourist travel will soon become popular, as a
bird’s-eye view of a country is the most satisfactory of all.</p>

<p>For several reasons, however, many will be unable to enjoy
this latest luxury, traveling <span class="allsmcap">IN THE BODY</span>, but <span class="allsmcap">WITH THE MIND</span> everyone
who desires can enjoy in the following pages, an aeroplane
trip through Ireland, fairest of all lands.</p>

<p>This mental excursion in the aeroplane has obvious advantages
over a like physical experience, as every aeronaut will cheerfully
acknowledge. Future aerial travelers over Erin will be able
to witness to the truthfulness of this bird’s-eye view of Ireland,
and I trust the historical allusions will add to the interest of our
survey of the island’s lovely scenes. The visits to Irish homes,
and the glimpses of Irish character will also, I am sure, be enjoyed.</p>

<p>I wish to thank Hon. William Jennings Bryan for the Introductory
Chapter, in which, from the viewpoint of a practical
statesman, he shows the bright future of the Emerald Isle. The
full account of this famous visit of his to Ireland was published
in the Commoner, which owns the copyright.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My</span>
visit to Ireland was too brief to enable me
to look into the condition of the tenants in
the various parts of the island, but by the
courtesy of the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr.
Timothy Harrington, and Mr. John Dillon, both members
of Parliament, I met a number of the prominent
representatives of Ireland in national politics.</p>

<p>It is true that home rule has not yet been secured,
but the contest for home rule has focused attention upon
the industrial and political condition of Erin, and a number
of remedial measures have been adopted.</p>

<p>First, the tenant was given title to his improvements
and then the amount of the rent was judicially
determined. More recently the authorities have been
building cottages for the rural laborers. Over 15,000
of these cottages have already been erected and arrangements
are being made for some 19,000 more. These
are much more comfortable than the former dwellings,
and much safer from a sanitary point of view. The
recent Land Purchase Act, which went into effect on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
November first, (1903), seems likely to exert a very
great influence upon the condition of the people. According
to its terms the Government is to buy the land
from the landlord and sell it to the tenants.</p>

<p>As the Government can borrow money at a lower
rate than the ordinary borrower, it is able to give the
tenant much better terms than he gets from his present
landlord, and at the same time purchase the land of the
landlord at a price that is equitable. The landlords are
showing a disposition to comply with the spirit of the
law, although some of them are attempting to get a
larger price for their land than it was worth prior to
the passage of the law.</p>

<p>The purpose of the law is to remove from politics the
landlord question, which has been a delicate one to deal
with. Most of the larger estates were given to the ancestors
of the present holders, and many of the owners
live in England and collect their rents through a local
agent. The new law makes the Government the landlord;
and the tenant, by paying a certain annual sum
for 63 years, becomes the owner of the fee. He has the
privilege of paying all, or any part, at any time, and can
dispose of his interest.</p>

<p>The settlement which is now being effected not only
removes the friction which has existed between the tenant
and the landlord, but puts the tenant in a position
where he can appeal to the Government with reasonable
certainty of redress in case unforeseen circumstances
make his lot harder than at present anticipated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p>The assurance that he will become the owner of the
fee will give to the Irish farmer an ambition that has
heretofore been wanting, for he will be able to save
without fear of an increase in the rent.</p>

<p>Not only is the land question in process of settlement,
but there has been at the same time other improvements
which make for the permanent progress of
the people. There is a constant increase in educational
facilities, and a large number of co-operative banks have
been established. Agricultural societies have been formed
for the improvement of crops and stock, and the trend
is distinctly upward. The Irish leaders have not obtained
all that they labored for—there is much to be secured
before their work is complete, but when the history of
Ireland is written, the leaders now living will be able to
regard with justifiable pride the results of their devotion
and sacrifice and their names will be added to the
long list of Irish patriots and statesmen.</p>

<p>In Dublin I paid my respects to Lord Dudley, Lieutenant
Governor of Ireland, whose residence, the Viceregal
Lodge, is in Phoenix Park, and found him so genial
and affable a host that I am led to hope that in his administration
of the executive branch of the Government
he will make the same attempt at just treatment that
parliament has made in the enactment of the recent land
measures.</p>

<p>Dublin is a very substantial looking city and much
more ancient in appearance than Belfast, the latter reminding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
one more of an enterprising American city.
We did not have a chance to visit any of the industries
of Dublin, and only a linen factory and a shipyard in
Belfast, but as the linen factory, The York Street Linen
Mills, was one of the largest in Ireland, and the shipyard,
Harland and Wolff’s, the largest in the world, they
gave some idea of the industrial possibilities of the
island.</p>

<p>Queenstown, Ireland, the first town to greet the
tourist when he reaches Northern Europe and the last
to bid him farewell when he departs, is a quaint and interesting
old place. Here the returning traveller has a
chance to spend any change which he has left, for blackthorn
canes and shillelaghs, “Robert Emmett” and “Harp
of Erin” handkerchiefs and lace collars are offered in
abundance. At Queenstown one can hear the Irish brogue
in all its richness and, if he takes a little jaunt about the
town, he can enjoy the humor for which the Irish are
famed.</p>

<p>To one accustomed to the farms of the Mississippi
and the Missouri valleys, the little farms of Ireland seem
contracted indeed, but what they lack in size they make
up in thoroughness of cultivation. The farm houses
are not large, but from the railroad train they looked
neat and well kept.</p>

<p>There is a general desire among the leaders of
thought in Ireland to check the emigration from that
country. They feel that Ireland, under fair conditions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
can support a much larger population than she now has.
Ireland, they say, has been drained of many of its most
enterprising and vigorous sons and daughters. It is
hardly probable that the steps already taken will entirely
check the movement towards the United States, but
there is no doubt that the inhabitants of Ireland and
their friends across the water contemplate the future
<em>With Brighter Hopes and Anticipations</em> than they have
for a century.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span>
all happened in this way. Early last summer
I was travelling through Ohio and came
to the prosperous city of Dayton. While
spending a few days visiting in this enterprising
city, a friend met me, and proposed to call on
the Wright Brothers, who had won wide fame as the
men who knew how to fly.</p>

<p>I was rather skeptical about a man contesting the
atmosphere with the fowls of the air. I had a private
opinion that Mother Earth was meant for man, and that
the nearer he kept to it the better. I went to see these
aeronauts with a prejudice against the flying business.</p>

<p>We soon found the airship factory, and we were
introduced to Mr. Wilbur Wright. He greeted us very
cordially, and even took us around his factory, showing
us an aeroplane and explaining its workings. I was
astonished at the simplicity of the airship and was impressed
with the enthusiasm of the successful young
aeronaut. I began to thaw out. I asked a lot of questions.
Before half an hour had passed by I was a convert
to the flying business, and made up my mind that
Mr. Wright was a “bird.” He had discovered not only
how to fly, but also, which is more important, how to
light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p>That was the beginning of my interest in aeroplanes.
I do not expect that anything wonderful would
have come out of my Dayton experience had I not journeyed
the next week to New York State to visit an old-time
friend, Mr. Mike Connor. Naturally, I began to
display my new-found knowledge about aeronautics on
the first opportunity. To my great surprise I found that
Mr. Connor was also an enthusiastic aeroplanist. I
found he knew all about flying. When I expressed wonder
at his knowledge of this recent art of cleaving the
heaven’s blue, he told me he had been studying the matter
for a long time. He said he could get few of his
friends to take any stock in this latest victory of man
over nature, and he was delighted to find me a sympathetic
listener to his descriptions of the coming uses of
flying machines.</p>

<p>Looking carefully around the room, as if to see
that no unfriendly ear could hear, he finally confessed to
me in a stage whisper:</p>

<p>“I have an aeroplane of my own. I bought it two
months ago, and I can now fly with it beautifully.”</p>

<p>“Good,” I cried, “let me see it.”</p>

<p>He at once took me out to the shed where he kept
the “bird.” I looked it over with intense interest, which
pleased my good friend, Mike, (as I must call him) very
much. It was a Wright aeroplane, about the same size
as the one Mr. Wilbur Wright had shown me at Dayton.
The two main planes, like the top and bottom of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
street car, were 40 feet long and 7 feet wide. The distance
between the upper and lower planes was 6 feet.
These planes were covered with a stout cloth, like tent
cloth. There were two small horizontal planes in front,
controlled by levers, by which the aeroplane was raised
or lowered at will when it was in the air. At the rear
there was also a double set of planes, vertically placed, to
assist in turning the airship, just as a helm turns a ship
in the water. Motion was generated by two large propellers,
seven feet long, made of spruce wood, which
ran in opposite directions. Power was furnished by a
compact, 25-horse power motor, which Mike, whom I
knew to be an expert with gasoline engines, said was
one of the best he ever handled.</p>

<p>“Just as reliable as steam,” he assured me, when I
spoke of the unreliability of the ordinary motor.</p>

<p>Mike explained to me how to start, how to rise and
descend, and how to turn in the air.</p>

<p>I asked him why he had not let me know about this
new treasure before, and he told me his friends to whom
he had spoken about it had treated him so coldly, that
he had ceased to mention the matter, but he had quietly
been practicing with his machine until now he was able
to fly anywhere. There was a large meadow back of
his house, surrounded by thick groves, and in this secluded
spot he had spent weeks perfecting himself in the
art of flying.</p>

<p>As it was too late that day for a flight he promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
to take me on my first jaunt among the clouds next
morning.</p>

<p>I had known Mike Connor since he was a boy. His
father had left him a lot of money, but he was not the
usual wild kind of heir. He looked after his estate
closely, but, having a heap of time on his hands, he was
always ready for a diversion. When the bicycles first
came out, he had two or three of the finest makes. He
was the very first in his neighborhood to purchase an
automobile, and he soon became an expert with his
motor car. Accordingly, I was not surprised to know
that he had so soon mastered the use of the aeroplane.</p>

<p>When we came back to the house he asked me suddenly:</p>

<p>“Jack, what are you going to do this summer?”</p>

<p>“I have been planning,” I replied, “to take a run
across the fish pond and visit old Ireland again.”</p>

<p>“Good,” he fairly shouted.</p>

<p>I looked at him a little curiously, wondering why
he was so interested in my visit to the Emerald Isle.</p>

<p>“Let us go together,” he continued enthusiastically,
“and take the aeroplane.”</p>

<p>This was certainly a novel proposition, and I
laughed so heartily at the idea of flying through Ireland
that Mike got impatient.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we can do it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Let us wait till morning,” I answered evasively,
“and we will see about it.” Mike’s face fell, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
could see he thought I was not a thorough convert to
the aeroplane art.</p>

<p>There is something of the Scotchman about me, and
I wanted to know a little more about the “bird” business
before I started on a vacation trip with wings. An Irish
bog would not be a bad place for an aeronaut to alight
in case he had to descend unceremoniously, but I didn’t
want to spoil a nice outing in Ireland by breaking my
neck trying to fly.</p>

<p>The next morning we were up with the birds and
soon had the aeroplane all ready for a flight. The
Wright aeroplane ascends from a “starting rail,” which
is merely a stout board turned up on end.</p>

<p>The meadow was an ideal place to fly. It was an
immense level field, about half a mile long, and quarter
of a mile broad. I had all confidence in Mike and had
no reason to believe he meant to destroy me, but I was
just a little shaky as I climbed up into the second seat
over the motor.</p>

<p>Mike vaulted easily into his seat, started the motor,
and in a few seconds we were off. I can never describe
the excitement of the next ten minutes. We rose to the
height of about 80 feet, and then sailed rapidly round and
round the field. The sensation of flying was something
entirely new. I was exhilarated, charmed, delighted.
After I became a little used to it I was able to observe
the field below, which glided under us with marvelous
speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p>After ten minutes of this thrilling experience Mike
decided to land, as he did not wish to try my nerves too
severely the first time. The landing was perfect. Mike
shut off the motor at a height of 70 feet, and the aeroplane
came gliding down like a big bird. I could not tell
just when we came to earth, so gently did the airship
alight. It glided along on its runners for a short distance
and then came quietly to a stop.</p>

<p>I stepped out on the grass like a man in a dream.</p>

<p>“How did you like it?” asked Mike.</p>

<p>For answer I fairly hugged him. He was pleased
and asked at once about a trip through Ireland.</p>

<p>“It would be grand,” I exclaimed, “let us go.”</p>

<p>We had several other flights together and we were
both confident that we could have a glorious time in the
Emerald Isle with an airship.</p>

<p>We soon completed our arrangements. The aeroplane
was taken to pieces and carefully packed. Each
box was marked “Queenstown.”</p>

<p>In three weeks’ time we were ready to start. We
booked on the Lusitania, and, as the boxes, in which our
aeroplane was stored, were taken on board as baggage,
we landed in five days at Queenstown, airship and all.</p>

<p>I had crossed the Atlantic several times before, but
this voyage was the most exciting of all. We sat on
deck and talked of our plans when we landed. Mike
was sure of his ability to fly a day at a time, and so we
outlined a strenuous program. I was well acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
with Ireland, and I had marked our stopping places as
we would fly through the island.</p>

<p>Sometimes fear of failure would take possession of
my mind. The whole thing was so novel. Such a thing
as flying round a country on a sightseeing trip had
never been attempted. I was fearful I had been rash.</p>

<p>A talk with Mike always sent these fears to the
winds. He had no fears whatever.</p>

<p>As Mike was to have the chief share in piloting our
airship, I decided to take generous notes and prepare a
full account of the places we visited and our most exciting
experiences as we flew over the green fields of
Erin. From these notes I have prepared for the world
the account of our trip which is found in the following
chapters.</p>

<p>We had not breathed a word about our plans to
anyone on board during our voyage across the Atlantic,
and when we landed at Queenstown we quietly sent on
our “baggage” to Cork, and followed ourselves that
evening. We had planned to begin our flight from
Cork. We expected to fly around the island in a couple
of days and then visit some attractive places one by one.
We were compelled to change this plan, as we shall see.</p>

<p>After a good night’s rest at the Imperial Hotel in
Cork, we “assembled,” as aeronauts say, the various
parts of our airship the next morning on a level field
just outside the city.</p>

<p>We avoided the public as much as possible, and the
few people who came around found us non-committal,
and wondered what we were doing.</p>

</div>
<p class="p2"></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>In the evening when we were left alone, about nine
o’clock, (it is still quite light at this time in Ireland
during July) we made a short trial ascent. Our first
flight beneath the kindly Irish skies was a complete success.
Everything was working beautifully.</p>

<p>Well satisfied with our first day’s work we returned
to our hotel for the night. Our plan was to fly the first
day as far as the Giant’s Causeway, going up the West
side of the island. On the second day we expected to
return to Cork and make trips here and there after that.</p>

<p>We had another good night’s rest, and rose with
the sun, or rather a little before it. We found our aeroplane
in the field as we left it, and after carefully examining
every part, Mike said:</p>

<p>“All right, Jack. Let us start.”</p>

<p>I climbed up on my seat. Mike started the motor.
The machine began to move along the starting rail, and
rose like a bird. When we had gone up to about the
height of 200 feet we circled around over Cork. In the
dawning light we could see the strange tower of the
Church of Saint Mary Shandon, St. Patrick’s Street,
and the beautiful Cathedral of St. Finbar’s. I could also
distinguish Queen’s College.</p>

<p>Turning in a northwestern direction, Mike said to
me:</p>

<p>“Now we’re off.”</p>

<p>We were speeding through the air towards Killarney.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span>
was just 4:30 by my watch as we started
from Cork on that eventful 11th day of
July. There was good daylight, but the
city was still wrapped in its slumbers.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful summer morning and our spirits
rose with the aeroplane. We began the strangest trip
through Ireland that was ever made by man. I can
never forget the sight of the green fields of County Cork
that morning. It was a scene of peaceful loveliness.</p>

<p>The first place of interest we passed over was Blarney
Castle, which is only five miles from Cork. We
swept directly over the famous ruin, and I had a strange
feeling as I looked down on the far-famed fortress from
my aerial seat. As I had been at Blarney Castle before
I was able to locate that part of the wall where the
Blarney Stone is seen. I tried to point it out to Mike,
but, before I could get the place described, we had flown
over it. We learned that to describe anything like that
on the aeroplane you have to look as far ahead as possible.
I had no idea the country around Blarney was so
beautiful until I had a good bird’s eve view of it. I was
convinced that we would see all the scenic beauties of
Ireland from our aeroplane as they had never been seen
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>The distance from Cork to Killarney is 50 miles as
the crow flies, and as we were now traveling like crows
we measured distances as they did. We could see the
River Lee at our left as it meandered through the neat
farms and little fields of the Cork farmers. The pleasant-looking
cottages fairly flew beneath us. We were
surprised to see so much of County Cork under cultivation,
as we expected to see it all in grazing land. I
found out later that under the beneficent new Land
Laws most of these small farmers now own their own
farms, and that this part of Ireland is prospering.</p>

<p>It was a perfect picture that met our gaze as we
looked around. The small fields were divided with thick
hedges, or stone walls, sometimes with a wall of earth.
Groves were frequent. Here and there a lordly mansion
peered out at us through the trees.</p>

<p>Quite a distance to our left we could see
Macroom, where the railroad from Cork ends. It looked
so quiet and still in that region that morning that I
was reminded that there was a tradition that the gentle
Quaker, William Penn, was born there. Penn’s father
had a seat at Macroom, but I think the young William
gave his first cry in London. At least, I once saw the
font in a London church in which he was immersed as
a tiny infant.</p>

<p>“Now for the mountains,” said Mike, as the Kerry
hills drew near. Their peaks loomed up before us big
as the Himalayas. Mike began to raise the airship
higher and higher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<p>Right here I want to confess that often throughout
the whole trip in this aeroplane with Mike I had shaky
feelings that were a little unpleasant. Once in a while
in imagination I could see myself tumbling over and
over to the ground, like a wounded bird. Nor were my
fears altogether groundless, as we shall see. If Mike
had any such apprehensions he never said a word to me
about it. I rather think he was so busily engaged constantly
with the operation of the aeroplane that he had
little time to think of anything else. I had much better
chance to see the country than he did, but I also had
more time on my hands during which I could conjure
up all kinds of disasters. I well remember that, as we
rose to a dizzy height, in order to clear the Kerry Mountains,
I had almost a nervous attack. For a moment I
shut my eyes and heartily wished I was on the earth
again. If I could have gotten safely to land just then, I
am afraid that all the gold in Ophir would not have
tempted me to fly again. I was roused by a cry from
Mike.</p>

<p>“Look,” he fairly shouted, “isn’t that grand?”</p>

<p>I opened my eyes quickly and saw Mike, with his
face all aglow, gazing on a high peak which we soon
recognized as Mount Mangerton.</p>

<p>It towered far above us, high as we were, for this
peak is over 2,700 feet high. Soon the Devil’s Punchbowl,
another high mountain peak, with a flat top, came
into view. This mountain, which is over 2,600 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
high, is easily recognized. Formerly it was a volcano,
but long ago burnt itself out. The crater is now filled
with clear, cold spring water, which is piped to the village
of Killarney. It is surely an Irishism to call this
beautiful water from this huge natural reservoir the
“devil’s punch.”</p>

<p>We were looking so intently on these great hills
that we crossed the crest of the divide before we were
aware. All at once Mike startled me again.</p>

<p>“In the name of all that is great, look there,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Never can I forget the sight that lay before us as
I lowered my eyes and caught my first glimpse of the
Vale of Killarney. The panorama was one of surpassing
loveliness. There was no fear whatever in my heart
now. All was wonder, admiration, delight. The three
Killarney Lakes lay embosomed among the towering
hills. The Lakes are fully eleven miles long and at one
place two and a half miles broad. Magnificent forests
fringe them on every side, and over sixty wooded islands
float in the charmed waters. Just ahead of us was
Muckross Abbey. This ancient Abbey was founded in
1440 by the McCarthys, and is a notable ruin. The
walls and tower are in good condition. We could see
the ivy glisten in the morning light from the top of
the tower, and I caught a passing glimpse of the gigantic
yew tree, nearly fourteen feet in circumference, which
every visitor to Muckross Abbey will remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<p>“Hurrah for old Ireland,” cried Mike, as we glided
down to within 150 feet of the waters of the Upper
Lake. We soon rose again to about 300 feet above the
water, as this gave us the best view, and at this altitude
we sailed triumphantly along the entire course of the
Lakes.</p>

<p>Here we first noticed the effect that an aeroplane
had on the ordinary denizens of the earth. It was now
6:00 o’clock, and some early risers among the tourists
at Killarney were enjoying the marvels of a Killarney
morning along the banks. We could hear their excited
exclamations as they caught sight of us, but we flew on
majestically.</p>

<p>We soon passed the two smaller Lakes, which are
joined by short narrow streams, and discerned Ross
Castle clothing itself with all the glories of a morning
of sunshine as it has done, every time it has had a
chance, for 600 years. I say “every time it has had a
chance” advisedly, for all who are acquainted with Killarney
weather know that this fine ruin is often compelled
to clothe itself with morning mists and rain.</p>

<p>Ross Castle was on our right and, beyond it, we
could see Kenmare House, the home of the Earl of Kenmare,
who owns Killarney. It is situated in the midst
of a lovely park, with beautiful gardens, covering fully
1900 acres of woodland and lawn. However, as Mike
and I sailed past it in our airship we would not have
exchanged places with the Earl himself. Beyond Kenmare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
House we could see Killarney village straggling
along amongst the trees. We were now crossing the
Lower Lake, which is the largest, being nearly six miles
long. We turned to our left and gazed with awe at the
towering peaks which enclose this scene of beauty. The
shifting of the light among the hills was glorious. Looking
over our shoulders to the left we caught sight of
Carntual, over 3,400 feet high, the highest mountain
in Ireland. Altogether there are six prominent peaks,
and as they rise from the level they make a majestic
scene. We passed directly over the Innisfallen island.
This large and beautiful island in the Lower Lake covers
twenty-one acres and from above it looked like “a beautiful
miniature of a beautiful country.” We could see
the famous ruins of Innisfallen Abbey on the island.
This Abbey was founded in 600 by St. Finian, and it is
one of the oldest ecclesiastical ruins in Erin. The Irish
poet, Thomas Moore, has immortalized this little Island
in his ode:</p>

<p>
“Sweet Innisfallen, fare thee well.”
</p>

<p>After passing Innisfallen we discussed our further
route. Mike wanted to circle over the Lakes again, but
I objected. I wanted to carry away the remembrance
of Killarney as I had seen it for the first time from an
aeroplane. I was afraid a second look would take away
some of the charm. Mike also wanted to go up the Gap
of Dunloe, but I also objected to this, as I wished to hurry
on direct to the North of Ireland that day. We compromised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
by agreeing to turn around at the north end
of the lakes, and make a circle over the north part of
Lower Lake, while we took our last look at Killarney’s
Vale.</p>

<p>When we had finally turned our backs on the glorious
scene and Mike started north over the high plains,
I repeated softly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Beauty’s home, Killarney,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heaven’s reflex Killarney.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Angels fold their wings and rest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In this Eden of the West.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mike roused me rudely from my dreams by remarking:</p>

<p>“These two angels haven’t folded their wings from
the looks of things. See how the ground flies past.”</p>

<p>I laughed good-naturedly and gradually woke up
from the spell of the beauteous Lakes of Killarney.</p>

<p>I pulled out my watch. It was 6:20. A short time
later we caught sight of the railroad between Killarney
and Tralee and followed it about 100 feet above the
tracks.</p>

<img alt="A" class="drop-cap" height="70" src="images/i_037.jpg" width="70">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span>
we winged our way above the railroad ties
we rested after the excitement of Killarney.
We were now in the heart of Kerry. This
part of Ireland is not as prosperous as some
other parts. The land is hilly and rocky. Fences are
generally made of stone. The little cottages are also
built of stone, thatched with straw. We could see the
stack of peats beside them to be used as fuel, and the
little potato patch which furnished food. Blue smoke
was beginning to curl in the air from some of these
cabins, telling us that rural Ireland was awakening for
another day of life, such as it is.</p>

<p>Of all the sensations that ever visited Ireland, we
surely were the greatest in modern times. We were
much amused to see the different ways in which our appearance
in the air was greeted. Sometimes the children
(plentiful throughout all Ireland) would be playing
in front of the cabin. As they heard the noise of our
motor we could see them stop their play and gaze at us
in amazement, and then, with a yell, all would dive at
once for the door of their home. The mother, generally
with a baby in her arms, would appear quickly. Sometimes
the woman would shriek, like the children, and
run inside again. At other times we noticed the women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
get down on their knees, as in prayer. Once or twice,
the woman ran out and waved her arms at us, as though
in greeting. The men generally looked stolidly at us in
mute amazement.</p>

<p>We had an exciting time when passing a morning
train coming from Tralee. We could see it smoking in
the distance, and to avoid a collision, as Mike said, we
turned the aeroplane about 100 feet to the right side of
the track. The engineer caught sight of us first, and
signalled us with a number of toots on his whistle. The
tooting brought the passengers to the windows and soon
heads were sticking out along the side of the train from
one end to the other. They waved their hats, handkerchiefs,
umbrellas, newspapers, and I saw one old gentleman
vigorously shaking a book at us. I took out my
handkerchief and waved it in return. The engineer kept
tooting his whistle until he was far past us.</p>

<p>We watched the little Kerry cows, which looked
carefully for any stray vegetation to be found in the
Kerry uplands, for we had heard that the Kerry cow
never looks up, for fear it would lose a bite. Certainly
none looked up at us. Cows and men have a serious
time of it in Kerry, forcing a churlish soil for daily
food. Many of the men in Kerry spend part of the year
in England working there, while the wives and children
look after the cabbage and potato patches. We saw pigs
and goats, and a few sheep around some of the cottages.</p>

<p>The English Government has a Board, called the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Congested Districts’ Board, which is at present doing
excellent work in assisting the people of Kerry and
others of these hilly western counties. This board aids
in migration to other parts of Ireland, if it is found necessary,
and also assists in developing the country as far
as is possible. Breeds of stock are improved through
its help, and industries, such as rug-making, lace-making
and basket-making, are encouraged. This Board has
also been useful in developing the fisheries industry on
the west coast by constructing landing places and equipping
boats for the fishermen.</p>

<p>As the morning advanced, and the entire population
had aroused itself we were kept in a state of continual
amusement by the excitement we caused, as we whizzed
across the solitary moors. I felt real sympathy with
Bridget, who, as she walked from the wedding altar on
Pat’s arm, whispered to him:</p>

<p>“If we could only stand and see ourselves now,
wouldn’t it be hivin, Pat?” I felt if we could only see
ourselves from the ground and hear the comments of
the natives our bliss would have been full.</p>

<p>We passed Tralee at 6:35. This is a pretty town
situated on Tralee Bay. There are many beautiful residences
in its neighborhood. Lord Kirchener was born
here.</p>

<p>We were 200 feet in the air when we swept at full
speed over the closely built houses of the town. We
could see a few people stirring on the streets and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
looked up at us in wonder, but did not make any manifestation.
Evidently they knew what an aeroplane was.</p>

<p>After passing Tralee we kept close to the coast, and
soon saw the wide mouth of the river Shannon ahead of
us. This is Ireland’s largest river, 220 miles long, pouring
itself into the sea North of County Kerry. The Kerry
coast is rather bleak and it was with a feeling of relief
that we rushed across the wide mouth of the Shannon
into County Clare.</p>

<p>Here our motor gave its first trouble. As we were
crossing the Shannon it alarmed me by beginning to
“knock” (as motorists say) and Mike told me the sparker
was not working properly. We had planned to make
our first landing at Kilkee on the coast of Clare, and, as
this was not far distant, Mike kept on at full speed along
the coast. The coast scenery here is rugged and grand.
Kilkee is situated at the head of a little bay, called
Moore’s Bay. When we reached this bay Mike sped
clear out over its waters, to my amazement, and then
turned up the bay to Kilkee.</p>

<p>Coming up the bay we could see much excitement
on the shore near the town. People were running down
to the shore from all directions. Mike circled over the
town, about 300 feet in the air, and then came down on a
level stretch of coast beside the village.</p>

<p>Kilkee is over 100 miles from Cork, as the crow, or
aeroplane, flies. We landed exactly at 8:00 o’clock. As
I stepped from my seat, I felt stiff and lame, but a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
exercise straightened me out. Mike busied himself at
once with the motor. He began unscrewing the spark
plugs and overhauling the whole engine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the crowd kept gathering until, I suppose,
in ten minutes, the entire town was standing around
us open-mouthed. The boys in the crowd closed in on
us at once and began asking all sorts of questions.
When we told them we were from America the buzz of
excitement grew louder, as they thought at first that we
had crossed the Atlantic, since we came directly from
the sea. Mike, at last, explained that we had only come
from Cork that morning. This was wonderful enough
to them and we heard all kinds of exclamations. “The
Saints preserve us,” said one good lady, with a shawl
wrapped around her head, “what’s the world coming
to?”</p>

<p>“Begorra,” said a genuine Irishman, “I never
thought they could make a crow out of a man.”</p>

<p>Some volunteered the information that they had
sons, or brothers, in America, and it was not long until
the crowd and us were on familiar terms. We hired two
honest-looking fellows to watch the aeroplane, and keep
the boys off from it, while we went down the straggling
street of the town, looking for a place to get some refreshments.</p>

<p>A man, whom one of the bystanders assured us was
“the bist man in town,” took us in charge and escorted
us to his own home. His good wife, a kindly, middle-aged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Irish woman of the middle class, soon had a cup
of hot tea and some “scones” ready for us. This was
our first taste of Irish hospitality and it astonished us.</p>

<p>We found our host a most companionable man.
When we explained our plans about an aeroplane trip
all around Ireland, he said:</p>

<p>“You Americans can do anything.”</p>

<p>Our host accompanied us back to the airship where
there was still the same wondering crowd. The two
watchmen were busy keeping the little lads away from
the machine. They helped Mike arrange the starting
rail, and Mike and I took our seats.</p>

<p>Our guards cleared the way. Mike started the
motor, and shouted “Good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Bye-bye,” shouted the crowd, in the heartiest way.</p>

<p>“Come back again,” shouted our host.</p>

<p>At this a little boy piped up, to the amusement of us
all:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fly away Jack, fly away Jill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come back Jack, come back Jill.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Amid cheers we arose lightly from the earth, and
were soon speeding once more up the Clare coast towards
Galway. We left Kilkee at 9:00 o’clock.</p>

<p class="center">A THRILLING VISIT TO CONNEMARA</p>


<div>
<img alt="I" class="drop-cap" height="69" src="images/i_043.jpg" width="70">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I</span>
had read of the grandeur of the Irish seacoast
in County Clare, and I asked Mike to
keep as close to the sea as he could. He
obeyed me only too well, half of the time
being over the ocean.</p>

<p>The rugged cliffs grew more and more picturesque
as we neared Hag’s Head. After passing over this
promontory, the famous Moher Cliffs came into view.
These are sheer precipices, fully 600 feet high, and, as
seen from the ocean, they present a magnificent appearance.
In passing these cliffs our aeroplane was about
500 feet above the sea, and about 100 feet out from land,
so that we saw them to the best advantage. These cliffs
stretch along the coast for five or six miles. From the
Moher Cliffs we turned landward, in a northeastly direction,
as we wished to pass over the city of Galway, and
enter the Connemara country from the shores of Lake
Corrib.</p>

<p>The Clare farms seemed somewhat better than
those of Kerry, but not much. We saw many one-room
cabins. For many miles we flew about 60 feet over
Clare, and I observed the country with interest. Clare
and Galway are the present centers of unrest in Ireland.
There is where “cattle-driving” is practised most. Fences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
are destroyed and large herds of cattle, belonging to
some landlord, are scattered over the country roads,
The cause of “cattle-driving” is the enmity of the peasants
toward the landlords who turn their estates into
vast grazing farms, thus depriving the peasants of any
soil to cultivate.</p>

<p>The Government has tried to have the landlords
sell out their estates to these landless ones, but some refuse
to do so, and there is no compulsory legislation at
present in the matter of landlords selling to tenants.</p>

<p>As these landlords do not live in Ireland and have
little interest in Irish people the Government is now
seeking remedial legislation which will compel the landlord
to sell his estate. Absentee landlordism has been
Ireland’s historic curse for centuries. As one Irishman
expressed it: “Ireland has been <em>overrun</em> with absentee
landlords.”</p>

<p>For many years the English Government sought
merely to repress the outbreaks of the dissatisfied Irish.
Now, an honest attempt is being made to cure the cause
of the discontent, and this accounts for these Land
Laws, which have proved of such benefit already to the
Emerald Isle.</p>

<p>Absentee landlords are hard to intimidate by popular
outbreaks. On one occasion the angry tenants
threatened to shoot the steward of a particularly obnoxious
landlord, and the steward wrote about it to his master
in England. The brave Englishman promptly replied:
“Tell the tenants that no threat to shoot <em>you</em> will
terrify <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p>We reached Galway Bay shortly after ten o’clock
and fifteen minutes later we were circling over the ancient
city of Galway. Galway has been called a Dutch
city, and its architecture, as we looked down on it, did
seem more varied than the usual plain style of Irish
buildings.</p>

<p>We created great excitement as we circled over
the city at a height of 150 feet. The motor was acting
a little erratic occasionally, and I wanted Mike to alight,
but he disliked facing the curious crowds.</p>

<p>“There are lots of bogs in County Galway,” he said
laughingly. “We will light easy on one of them if the
motor stops.”</p>

<p>The river, connecting Lough Corrib and Galway
Bay, divides the city into two parts, connected by several
bridges. Crowds rushed out on the bridges as they
saw us fly overhead. We could hear them cheering and
some one fired off a pistol. This frightened Mike and he
started toward Lough Corrib, like a wild duck which
had been bombarded by a hunter.</p>

<p>I saw a fine old church in Galway, and I easily
recognized Queen’s College. It is a noble Gothic building.</p>

<p>This is one of the three “godless” Colleges, established
in Ireland by Queen Victoria early in her reign.
They are called “godless” by the Irish because they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
no specific religious instruction in their curriculum.
The other Queen’s Colleges are located at Belfast and
Cork.</p>

<p>We were now speeding over Lough Corrib, a large
fresh-water lake, where there is excellent fishing. Mike
is a keen fisherman and his teeth watered as I told him
of Lough Corrib’s reputation amongst the disciples of
Isaac Walton.</p>

<p>A few miles from Galway we turned west into the
heart of the far-famed Connemara country. As we
swept over this part of Ireland we could see why Connemara
is so celebrated. It makes a splendid panorama.
There are literally hundreds of little lakes, there is grand
mountain scenery, there are the heather and peat lands
in abundance.</p>

<p>We were glad to fly over it, however, rather than
live there, for the monotony and barren soil repel a man
with an active mind and a good stomach.</p>

<p>Men were scarce, but we saw some, mostly at work
in the peat lands. We caught sight of some Connemara
women also, with red skirts, and Mike said he thought
they were shoeless.</p>

<p>We went through the pass of Kylemore, called the
“Gem of Connemara.” Two lofty peaks rise on each
side, and, in order to avoid land currents, we had to rise
to a height of 500 feet in going through.</p>

<p>I was astonished to see in this out-of-the-way place
a magnificent country home. It was surrounded with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
an immense garden, and the walks and drives were beautified
with flaming red fuchsia hedges.</p>

<p>I hastily referred to my little guide book, and found
it was Kylemore Castle, and that an American lady lived
there. She was formerly Miss Helena Zimmerman,
of Cincinnati, Ohio, but she fell from grace and is now
known as the Duchess of Manchester. She must have
some pangs of conscience about it, for no live American
girl would live in this solitary region unless as an act of
penance for her sins.</p>

<p>We passed close enough to Clifden, the extreme
western point in Ireland, to see Clifden Castle, and also
the Marconi Station. Marconi found a resting place at
Clifden for the weary wireless messages after their long
flight across the Atlantic, and he has a large Station
here. He also found a resting place at Clifden for his
weary heart, as he married Miss O’Brien, a beauty of
Western Ireland.</p>

<p>We could hear plainly the sending of a wireless message.
It was like a bombardment, report following report,
like the discharge of artillery. Passing west of
the Twelve Pins, a striking group of mountains, we entered
County Mayo along the seacoast. Skirting Mount
Muilrea, 2,685 feet high, we turned northeast to Croagh
Patrick.</p>

<p>If Ireland’s mountains were pressed out, the area of
the island would be doubled. County Mayo resembles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
County Clare, and the stone cabins, little fields, and
winding roads, are all distinctly Irish.</p>

<p>We were now used to the excitement caused everywhere
as we whirred over the astonished peasants. One
Irishman in County Mayo amused us hugely. He must
have had ears like an Indian’s, for he heard our motor
while we were fully a mile behind him. Turning suddenly,
he gave our aeroplane one long look, and then,
dropping his bundle on the road, he started to run like a
hare, as if to make his escape. It may have been his
conscience that troubled him. Mike lowered the aeroplane
until we were not more than 25 feet above him, as
we shot directly over his head. Just as we passed above
him he let out an unearthly shriek.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a retributive act of justice, but, at
any rate, a few moments later we were a good deal more
scared than the Irishman.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My</span>
hand trembles as I recall Croagh Patrick,
and our flight over it. This mountain is
fully 2,500 feet high, and rises abruptly
from the shores of Clew Bay. In many ways
it was the most attractive mountain to me in all Ireland.
There is a flat plain, with some ruins, on the top of it,
and in former times it was a place of great sanctity.</p>

<p>Saint Patrick, after whom the mountain is named,
made several pilgrimages to its summit, and here St.
Patrick exercised magic power for Ireland’s welfare.
Here is the record in the historian’s own words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“St. Patrick brought together here all the demons,
toads, serpents, and other venomous creatures in Ireland
and imprisoned them in a deep ravine on the sea front
of the mountain, known as Lugnademon (the pit of the
demons) as fast as they came in answer to his summons,
and kept them safely there until he was ready to destroy
them. Then, standing on the summit of the Croagh,
St. Patrick, with a bell in hand, cursed them and expelled
them from Ireland for ever. And every time he rang
the bell thousands of toads, adders, snakes, reptiles and
other noisome things went down, tumbling neck and
heels after each other, and were swallowed up for ever
in the sea.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

<p>As we neared Croagh Patrick I bravely asked Mike
to sail over its flat top, and see this sacred spot. Mike
was ready to do it in a minute. He pulled the levers
and we began to ascend, while still over two miles distant
from the mountain. Higher and higher we went
when we reached an altitude of 2,000 feet, I could feel
my heart begin to thump.</p>

<p>Timing himself with an accuracy, which astonished
me, Mike sailed over the top of Croagh Patrick about 30
feet above the flat plain. He circled around once and
we passed close beside the ruin of the ancient chapel.
There is also a large Celtic Cross standing upright on
the summit.</p>

<p>I was so glad to have old Mother Earth so near
once more, that I suggested that we land. Mike was
going to bring the aeroplane down when he remembered
that there was no way to rig up a starting rail on the
top of Croagh Patrick, and so we kept on in our flight.
A minute afterwards I was sorry we did not alight,
anyhow.</p>

<p>After his second circle around the flat plain, which
is half a mile square, Mike started east, and in a couple
of minutes the earth was 2,500 feet below us. The suddenness
of the appearance of this vast abyss between us
and land seemed even to unnerve Mike for a moment. I
almost collapsed.</p>

<p>Then Mike did a foolish thing. He imagined he
could glide down from this height, and he shut off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
motor. We glided swiftly some 300 feet, and then I
could feel the aeroplane begin to sink under us. What
happened I do not just know. The first intimation I had
of real danger was Mike’s face as he quickly turned to
start the motor. I could hear the big propellers whiz
behind me. In starting the motor, Mike released a lever
for an instant. As we were descending with lightning
speed this was almost the cause of a fatal disaster. The
aeroplane began to rock violently, and I was almost
thrown from my seat. The accident to Orville Wright
and Lieutenant Selfridge at Washington the year before
flashed before my mind. I wondered if Mike could regain
control of the machine. I caught the sides of my
seat and braced myself against the foot-rail. Even then
I had difficulty in holding on. I glanced at Mike. His
face was pale. His eyes shone. Every muscle and
nerve was tense. He was like a rider on a runaway
horse, determined to assert his mastery. His self-control
was perfect.</p>

<p>In spite of Mike’s coolness I am surprised we escaped.
As the aeroplane kept sinking and rocking like
a ship in a storm, I closed my eyes and resigned myself
to my fate. I was aroused by Mike’s voice.</p>

<p>“A close call, Jack, old boy,” he said affectionately.
I could see that there were tears in his eyes. He was
thinking of me and of my escape. Brave Mike. I wanted
to hug him right there. I looked around and saw we
were about 500 feet above ground, the aeroplane gliding
smoothly through the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p>It was fortunate for us there was no breeze to
speak of. All that morning, except for a little while on
the seacoast, the wind gave us no trouble.</p>

<p>I was glad to see Westpoint a few miles ahead, as
we had planned to stop there for a lunch, and to replenish
our supply of gasoline, or petrol, as they call it in
Ireland.</p>

<p>One good thing came out of our Croagh Patrick
experience. I began to help Mike in operating the aeroplane.
I took entire charge of the motor, which I could
reach more readily than he could, at any rate. This
left him free to manage the levers. He was the captain
and gave all orders, but I started and stopped the motor
the rest of our trip.</p>

<p>I found this of advantage to me, especially after
the rapid descent from Croagh Patrick, as it gave me
something to do, and, when not engaged watching the
scenery, or consulting my map or guide-book, I could
busy myself with the motor.</p>

<p>We had other exciting incidents, but this division
of labor assisted us in keeping the aeroplane completely
under our control—as long as the motor worked.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Mike</span>
made an excellent landing in an open
space in a beautiful park beside Westpoint.
A small crowd soon gathered around us
when we lit, but Mike and I paid little attention
to them. I stepped out on the ground and looked
at my watch. It was one o’clock. We had been in the
air four hours. Mike felt the strain of this long aerial
journey also, but not so much as I did. He was more
accustomed to aeroplaning.</p>

<p>Our motor had been acting well, on the whole. It
was a new style motor, without carburetor, and I had
been suspicious of it, but it surpassed any motor I had
ever seen in reliability.</p>

<p>We had just finished stretching out our tired limbs
when a middle-aged man, with a kindly, honest face, but
an important air, came hurrying along the driveway of
the park in our direction.</p>

<p>We heard several in the crowd exclaim: “The
Keeper, the Keeper.” The new comer looked at us in
astonishment and then he inspected our aeroplane. Then
he looked at us again, and exclaimed: “By the Powers.”</p>

<p>We did not know what kind of a salutation this
might be, but Mike told what we were doing and why
we had alighted in the Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<p>The “Keeper,” as they called him, at once became
friendly and introduced himself as the Steward of the
Marquis of Sligo, in whose park we had alighted and
whose mansion was close at hand. The Steward resided
at the mansion, as the Marquis did not spend much time
on his Irish estate.</p>

<p>He invited us to come up to the mansion, which invitation
we gladly accepted. Following the Steward,
we soon arrived at the stately home of the Marquis of
Sligo, who owns the greater part of this section of Ireland.
He is an absentee landlord, but he comes to Westpoint
occasionally, and he treats his tenants liberally,
for an Irish landlord. The large park around his
mansion is open to all Westporters. We noticed, from
the signs, that automobiles were not allowed to enter
the park, but aeroplanes were not excluded, at least, not
yet.</p>

<p>The Steward served us a good lunch, and sent a
boy with a pony-cart to town to get the petrol. The
Sligo Mansion is luxuriously furnished, and Mike and I
felt like royal travellers.</p>

<p>The Steward’s kindness was explained when he began
to talk about America. He had two brothers in the
New World, and told us that tens of thousands of Irishmen
from County Mayo and County Galway had left
Ireland for America in the past twenty years.</p>

<p>Westport is the most westerly town in Ireland, and
is only 1,600 miles from Nova Scotia. At one time it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
was proposed to run a line of steamers from here to
America, but the project fell through.</p>

<p>We would like to have spent a day or two around
Westport, but we still thought we could reach the
Giant’s Causeway that evening, although I was beginning
to think that Antrim was quite a long ways off.</p>

<p>The Steward showed us around the gardens and
grounds, and even offered to drive us over the town,
but we were anxious to get started in the air again and
we declined. It was 2:00 o’clock when we had the
starting rail in place and had everything in readiness for
another flight.</p>

<p>An immense crowd had gathered around the aeroplane.
They made few remarks, evidently restrained
by the presence of the steward, for whom they showed
much respect. One or two did volunteer an Irish farewell.</p>

<p>“Ah, then,” said one old woman, “it’s not often we
have the blessing of such fine company, good luck to
your honors, and God send you safe back again.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said a good-natured Son of Erin, with
the map of Ireland all over his face. “Good-bye, and I
hope ye can <em>kape on your feet</em> until you land agin.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, sors,” said the Steward, “and keep
you safe and bring you back.”</p>

<p>One gets used to hearing the name of Deity in Ireland,
but it does not shock you. The Irish use God’s
name familiarly, but reverently; not lightly, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
France; or vulgarly, as so often in America. No one
calls on God to damn you in Ireland. God is appealed
to for blessing.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” Mike and I shouted, as we rose in the
air. The crowd broke out in cheers, as we sailed away
toward County Sligo.</p>

<p>We crossed several lakes and much enjoyed the rest
of our flight over County Mayo, but it is not a desirable
part of Ireland in which to till the soil. We passed over
a pretty little town on a railroad, called Castlebar. We
entered County Sligo near Swinford.</p>

<p>Just after entering County Sligo, Mike said to me:</p>

<p>“Where’s our sunshine?”</p>

<p>I looked around. The entire sky was overcast.
We were having the usual experience with the Irish
weather, which some one has said is as changeable as
the Irish character. Smiles and tears come at a moment’s
notice.</p>

<p>The clouds soon got to work and it began to drizzle.
Passing over Sligo we could see the farms improve,
and when we reached County Leitrim, which we entered
near Lake Allen, we could see a marked improvement.
The soil was fertile, the farms and houses were larger,
and there was a general air of prosperity apparent.</p>

<p>Our aeroplane whizzed through the misty, rainy atmosphere,
like an ocean liner through a fog, but as the
upper plane got soaked through, it began to leak down
on us, and the water-logged planes made the machine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
more difficult to control. Mike told me that the airship
was not built for Irish weather, but he afterwards remedied
this defect, as we shall see.</p>

<p>When we reached County Fermanagh we began
to realize Ireland’s agricultural possibilities. Ulster is
a different world from Connaught. The landscape is
rolling, covered with cultivated farms. The houses are
often two-storied, slated, and neatly kept. There are
large barns and every appearance of prosperity. The
picture presented to us in Ulster was not so romantic as
in Connemara, but it is more like living. In many
parts of Connaught a crow would need to have its rations
along, but there are signs of plenty in Ulster. We
could well understand why the Irish did not altogether
approve of the grim Oliver’s dictum: “To Connaught
with every Irishman.”</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the North of Ireland are also
different from the Irish of the West. They are largely
Protestant in religion and of Scotch descent. Their
forefathers were brought to Ireland by James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, in the
early part of the 17th century. Several of the English
rulers had a good deal to do with the history of Ireland.
Henry <abbr title="the eighth">VIII.</abbr>, Queen Elizabeth, Oliver Cromwell, and
James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr>, had extensive real estate dealings in the Emerald
Isle in years gone by, and when they had completed
their bargains the map of Ireland was altered and
the feelings of many of the Irish were badly lacerated.
It has taken centuries for these wounded feelings to heal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p>It was after four o’clock when we sighted the chimneys
of Enniskillen. This prosperous town is built on
Lake Erne, or Lough Erne, as the natives call it. Lough
Erne is another of Ireland’s large fresh-water lakes.
Enniskillen is famous as the city which, like Londonderry
endured victoriously a siege in 1689, the year of the
commotion between James <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> and William <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> Its
defenders manifested the greatest bravery. The banners
captured at the Battle of the Boyne, where William <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr>
defeated James <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, hang in Enniskillen’s Town Hall.</p>

<p>Tired and wet, I seconded heartily Mike’s suggestion
that we spend the night here. I felt that I could
not fly another mile. We came down rather abruptly
in a field near town. The water-soaked aeroplane had
become hard to control, and we narrowly missed a big
hawthorn hedge. A farm house was near by, and the
farmer came running to us, followed by a little crowd
of children of all ages. After explanations, we turned
the aeroplane over to him for the night, and trudged
into town. Walking seemed pleasant to us both, as we
had been flying for a whole day. In spite of the misty
rain, we enjoyed every step of our mile walk to the Royal
Hotel. We had a good Irish supper, or “tea,” as they
called it, and soon afterwards we retired for the night.</p>

<p>The day ended perhaps a little ingloriously, but we
were well content.</p>

and we expected to again enjoy the sight of Ireland’s
green fields lit up with sunshine.</p>

<p>When I arose I felt quite stiff and sore, and I saw
Mike moved around with more than his usual precision.
The prolonged flight of the previous day had wearied us
considerably. Some aeronauts may wonder we could
make such a long flight, but straight, cross-country aeroplaning
differs much from circling a mile track. The
aeroplane is not so comfortable as a dirigible balloon,
and a flight like Count Zeppelin’s recent cross-country
trip in Europe would be quite strenuous in the heavier-than-air
machines at present. But a journey of 300 or
400 miles a day, with proper stops, does not call for any
extraordinary endurance.</p>

<p>As we came down stairs to breakfast we heard a
band out on the street and we noticed an air of excitement
on every hand. We thought, at first, that we were
the occasion of the evident agitation, but a waiter soon
showed us that there were greater things, even, than
aeroplanists in Ireland on that day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span></p>

<p>“It’s a foine Twelfth of July,” he said to us.</p>

<p>“What about the Twelfth of July?” asked Mike.</p>

<p>The waiter stared at him, until Mike went on:</p>

<p>“What’s going on here today?”</p>

<p>Then the waiter, seeing we were ignorant Americans
explained to us how they celebrated the victory of the
Boyne every Twelfth of July, and how the celebration
that day was to be the biggest ever held. Then I remembered
how the great day in the North of Ireland is
the Twelfth of July, just as the Seventeenth of March is
the great day in the rest of Ireland. However, St.
Patrick’s Day is now generally observed in some way
not only in Ireland, but in all the world.</p>

<p>“Mike,” said I, “let us stay in Enniskillen today
and celebrate.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stay and rest,” said Mike, “and see what
they do here on the ‘glorious Twelfth’, as our waiter
calls it.”</p>

<p>After breakfast we went out on the streets, and
found them filling up with a holiday crowd. I was
reminded of a celebration of July Fourth in America.
Excursion trains coming in from different points in the
surrounding territory added to the crowd every hour.
These excursion parties brought with them in every case
one or two fife bands, and occasionally a brass band.
These bands played popular airs to the great delight of
the crowd. All these numerous bands, and the immense
crowd of Irishmen and Irish women, gathered in a large
field beside Enniskillen. It was a scene of the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
enthusiasm. Bands in different parts of the field were
playing different airs. All was hub-bub and excitement.
There were stands all around where all kinds of drinks
were sold. Already several plainly showed that they had
been drinking a liquid much stronger than lemonade.
Lads and lasses were walking around, jostling, crowding
and laughing. It was a good-natured crowd, as there
was no counter-demonstration of any kind, as happens
sometimes in other parts of Ireland, I understand. The
differences between the Roman Catholic and Protestant
are very acute in the Emerald Isle for several reasons.
Often the two sides have bitter disputes. In this controversy,
as in all else, the inevitable humor of the
Irish sometimes crops out. The famous Father O’Leary
had a polemical contest with the Protestant Bishop of
Cloyne. The Bishop, in a pamphlet, inveighed with
great acrimony against the doctrines of the Roman
Catholic Church, and particularly against purgatory.</p>

<p>Father O’Leary, in his reply, slyly observed, “that,
much as the Bishop disliked purgatory, he might go
farther and fare worse.”</p>

<p>When Dean Swift was at Carlow, he found the
Episcopal Church badly dilapidated. “Why don’t you
give it to the Catholics?” said the caustic Dean. “You
know they would repair it and <em>you could take it from
them afterwards</em>.” It is not theology alone that separates
Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. The real estate
deals of the English Kings and Queens have something
to do with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>

<p>We enjoyed immensely our day in Enniskillen. We
saw a typical North of Ireland crowd, heard an Irish
orator declaim against “the foes of Ireland,” listened to
Irish bands, and shared in the enthusiasm of the occasion.
There was an excursion steamer running on Lough Erne
and in the afternoon we had a delightful boat ride. In
the evening, while at supper, we had a sample of real
Irish wit. There was a large sign in the dining room
with this notice: “Strangers are requested not to give
any money to the waiters, as attention is charged for
in the bill.”</p>

<p>Our waiter saw Mike reading this sign, and remarked
to him:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mister, sure that doesn’t concern you at all.
<em>We’re not makin’ a stranger o’ you, sor.</em>”</p>

<p>We laughed heartily, and told him we never felt
more at home in our lives. “Tips” are as necessary
in Ireland, even when traveling with an aeroplane, as
raincoats.</p>

<p>We had been informed that we would find wretched
hotels in Ireland, but the Imperial Hotel at Cork and the
Royal Hotel at Enniskillen, are excellent hotels, and, as
a rule, we found the hotel accommodations satisfactory.
In the evening, before dark, we sauntered forth, and
Mike went into a “shop,” as they call stores in Erin,
and bought out their entire supply of light oil-cloth.
Taking this with us, we went out to see our aeroplane.
In the excitement of July Twelfth, the news of our
strange craft evidently did not spread very wide, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
were very glad to escape notoriety in Enniskillen. We
found the airship just as we left it the previous night.
The farmer wondered what had become of us. Mike
got some tacks and a hammer, and covered the upper
plane entirely with oil-cloth.</p>

<p>“Even an airship needs a rain-coat in this country,”
said Mike to the farmer.</p>

<p>“But, sor,” said the farmer, “it’s such a gentle rain
we have here.”</p>

<p>The oil-cloth was quite a good idea on the part of
Mike. It gave us both a big umbrella during the rest
of our trip, and the sudden showers were not so
disagreeable.</p>

<p>The next morning we started at 5:00 o’clock, and
after rewarding our farmer friend for his care of the
aeroplane, we ascended into the Irish atmosphere again.
After circling over Enniskillen, we turned North, and,
leaving Lough Erne far to the West, we sped, like a
gigantic eagle, towards Tyrone.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span>
were almost an hour in reaching Omagh,
the county seat of County Tyrone. As we
flew over the city we were surprised to see
how new-looking it was in appearance, as
it is one of Ireland’s oldest towns. I learned later that
the old town had been destroyed some two hundred
years ago, and that Omagh of today is comparatively
modern. It is a neat and prosperous city, with streets,
some of them very steep, running in every direction.
A beautiful Cathedral adorns the hillside, and an old
barracks, now used as a police station, is an imposing
structure. There are several large Presbyterian churches
which show every sign of progress and prosperity.
There were only a few people on the streets when we
winged our way across the city at 6:00 o’clock. These
stared up at us and we could see them running to the
high places to keep us in sight. The farms in County
Tyrone looked large compared with the microscopic
farms of Connaught and Kerry, but they looked very
small to an American. The macadamized roads are
models in the way they are kept up, but they are narrow
and winding. When the wagon roads cross a railroad,
there is never a grade crossing. Generally the wagon
road runs over the railroad, but occasionally dips under
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<p>We had another exciting experience with an early
train from Omagh to Derry. We caught up with this
train at Newtonstewart, a picturesque little place. The
engineer saw us, and, like his fellow-Irishman in County
Kerry, he tooted his whistle in our honor. We flew
alongside the train for several miles, about 100 feet
from the side of the track, and 30 feet high in the air.
As the race continued, every passenger grew more and
more excited. They cheered and shouted. Mike, with
both his hands on his levers, could only look down and
grin, but I was able to wave my handkerchief and cap.
The engineer gave one long, farewell toot, as he stopped
at a station, while we flew on our way.</p>

<p>At Strabane, a good-sized town, some twenty miles
from Londonderry, we created wild excitement. A
number of people were around the station, as we whizzed
past, just about 20 feet in the air, directly over the
railroad tracks. We rose to a height of 75 feet just
after passing the station, and we could hear their loud
cheering, as we rose like a bird. The river Foyle formed
at Strabane by the junction of the rivers Finn and
Mourne, flows from Strabane to Derry (as Londonderry
is called by the natives) a wide and noble stream.</p>

<p>Mike turned the aeroplane directly over the river
after we left Strabane, and we flew above it for many
miles. This Foyle Valley is a rich agricultural country,
and I could see the crops of oats, flax, turnips, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
potatoes, growing in luxuriance in the fertile little fields.
About half way between Strabane and Derry our motor
gave us the first serious trouble. While we were sailing
along over the river, all at once it stopped, like a balky
horse.</p>

<p>“Start the motor, Jack,” Mike yelled, thinking I
had shut her off.</p>

<p>“It stopped itself,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Gee-whitaker,” said Mike, and I could see him
tug at the levers in order to turn the airship towards
the shore and bring it safely to the ground. Fortunately
we were quite high in the air, fully 200 feet, and we
were only a short distance from the east bank of the
river. In a few seconds Mike had brought us down
safely, a few yards from the river’s edge, on the flat
embankment. Mike soon remedied the trouble—a screw
had loosened. How to get started again was now our
problem, as we needed some kind of starting rail. Some
men around a group of houses a short distance away,
saw us, and came running with all speed. They stared
and gaped at us without saying a word. Mike spoke
to one of them, and explaining our trouble, asked him to
get a long stout board, to use as a starting rail. The
rustic ran back to the cottages, and soon returned with a
good board, which Mike soon turned into a starting rail.
Meanwhile, his companions began to make remarks, in
true Irish style, about the aeroplane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t that a new way to ‘<em>hoof it</em>’?” said a fellow
with an Irish cast of countenance.</p>

<p>“Let us get one, and then we can fly to America,”
said one of the youngest of them, a lad about eighteen
years of age. The young fellows in rural Ireland all
look upon America as the Eldorado of the world.</p>

<p>One of them said to me: “I should think, sor, your
air-boat would be lonesome in Ireland.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Because,” said Erin’s son, “it’s the only one in
the whole country, sor.”</p>

<p>“Come back again, sors,” one of them shouted as
we arose from the earth to continue our journey. We
noticed this is a familiar parting phrase in Erin.</p>

<p>It was seven o’clock when we saw the smoke of
Derry. In spite of our recent mishaps, Mike steered
right into the middle of the Foyle, as we came close
to the city. At Derry the river is spanned by a fine
iron bridge. As we passed over this bridge, about
twenty feet above it, we frightened a passing horse into
a runaway, and attracted the attention of a crowd of
laborers, who were crossing the bridge. Speeding on
down the Foyle, we saw below us the masts and funnels
of a number of ships, for Derry is an important seaport.
Along the docks crowds of working men greeted us
with shouts, and some of the steamers sent us a scream
of whistles. I was much interested in old Derry. I had
visited it often before, and, when we reached the end of
the docks, I asked Mike to circle clear around the city.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
We rose to a height of 300 feet, and the famous city lay
under us, like a picture. We could see the historic walls
which enclosed the ancient city, about a mile in circumference,
and still adorned with many antique cannon.
The well-remembered siege of Derry happened in 1689,
when James <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> besieged the city for 105 days, and the
gallant defenders were reduced to the greatest extremities.
To make matters worse, Colonel Lundy, who
commanded the garrison, turned traitor, and opened
negotiations with the besiegers. His treachery was
discovered, and he made his escape in disguise. Rev. Geo.
Walker, one of the heroes of the siege, has been remembered
with a fine monument, built on one of the bastions
of the wall. On this monument, every December 18th,
an effigy of the traitor, Lundy, is burned amid great
cheering by the descendants of the old defenders of
Derry. Derry Cathedral has interesting relics of this
famous siege, but it is not a noteworthy building from
an architectural viewpoint.</p>

<p>Derry is now quite an educational centre. Foyle
College is a prosperous institution with a pleasant location,
overlooking the river. Magee College, a Presbyterian
institution, is beautifully located on a high hill
north of the city. The architecture of the building is
stately, and this seat of learning is an important part of
modern Derry. A large number of the Irish Presbyterian
ministers are educated here.</p>

<p>We could see the large shirt factories, which bring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
much wealth, and lots of women into Derry. Most of
the employees are women.</p>

<p>The town on the east side of the Foyle is called
Waterside. There is a high bluff, just south of Waterside,
which is covered with villas owned by prosperous
Derrymen. We passed over a large military barracks
at the north end of Waterside. Evidently, some of the
officers in the barracks had been watching our flight
around the city, and they were ready for us. As we
swept over the barrack square, three large guns were
suddenly discharged, in our honor, we suppose. Mike
was so astonished at the sudden reports that he unconsciously
pulled a lever, making the aeroplane veer sharply
so that it began to rock. He had it under control again
in a moment, but we could hear the cheering of the red-coated
soldiers, as they noticed our maneuvers.</p>

<p>We sailed on, sorry to leave the historic Maiden
City (as Derry is proudly called because it was never
captured.) Shortly after passing the barracks, we
turned east, sailing over a number of delightful country
homes. Two miles east of Derry we passed over the
lovely valley of the Faughan river. This beautiful spot
was one of the finest scenes we found in the whole north
of Ireland. It was a valley filled with peace, quietness
and sunshine that morning. We went as far east as
Dungiven, a small country town about the centre of
County Derry. Many modern mansions adorn the
countryside, and the fertile soil well repays its careful
cultivation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span></p>

<p>“Look at the rain,” said Mike, as we turned north
from Dungiven.</p>

<p>And raining it was. While I was gazing down on
Derry’s green fields and lovely rivers, the clouds were
hastily gathering overhead, and threatening all kinds
of things. Soon the rain was pattering down upon
our aeroplane, but it fell harmlessly on our rain-coated
airship. It was only a shower, but while it lasted the
rain came down in a hurry. As an Irishman would put
it, some of the drops were “as big as a shilling or eighteen
pence.” In a little while the sudden tempest had spent
itself, and the sun was shining as though nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>We followed a small stream, called the Roe, to
Limavady, which we reached a little after eight o’clock.
We had planned to stop here for some refreshments for
ourselves, and our faithful “bird,” and Mike was delighted
to see a large level field near the town, where
he made a good descent, alighting without a jar. In five
minutes, people were running towards us in all directions.
We had circled the little town before alighting,
and had aroused everybody. They crowded around us
as at Kilkee, and soon began asking all kinds of questions.
We satisfied them as best we could, hired a watchman
to guard the aeroplane, and, accompanied by a motley
following, we walked into Limavady.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span>
ascended from Limavady at 8:30. We
were once more cheered to the echo as we
left the earth. After leaving Limavady, we
came to a low range of hills, and Mike had
to use his raising levers freely as we climbed their sides.
We saw the familiar heather and peat, and even the little
cabins, much the same as we saw in County Mayo. At
the top of the hills we had a magnificent view. We
could see Coleraine clearly, nestling beside the Bann
river, and, away in the distance, we saw again the sea.
The surrounding country was like a panorama. We
glided swiftly down the mountain side, and flew around
the quaint old town of Coleraine. Scotch-Irishmen live
in Coleraine, and it has the reputation of having the
best bakers in the whole island. Mike and I did not
condescend to test this, although it was perhaps as well
for us not to alight there, for Coleraine is famous for
something besides bread. Fine old Coleraine whisky
is known throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.
A Donegal clergyman, on hearing of a sermon against
drink, said: “Sure, I am forever at them about it. It’s
the bad stuff they take that does the mischief. I have
told them from the altar that I never touched a drop
myself <em>but the best Coleraine</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<p>Sky-pilots, whether spiritual or atmospheric, have
to leave whisky alone nowadays, so, in spite of its fame,
we merely circled over the city. Coleraine is known for
many centuries in Irish history. St. Patrick built a
church here. Columba visited it in 590. Later on the
salmon fishing in the river Bann, which flowed through
the city, made Coleraine a place of some commercial importance.
Like Derry and Enniskillen, Coleraine was besieged
in 1689 by the troops of James <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr>, and the
garrison was compelled to evacuate the town, and retreat
to Derry.</p>

<p>After passing over Coleraine, we came to the seacoast
again at Portstewart. I could see the row of
houses along the quay, in one of which Lever used to live.
Lever’s home was in Dublin, but he spent a year as a
dispensary doctor at Portstewart, and did some writing
here. A stiff breeze was blowing along the coast, and
Mike was kept busy handling the airship. Leaving
Portstewart, we went along the rough coast to Portrush.
This was formerly a dreaded coast, many a brave ship
going to pieces on the rocks. Portrush is the fashionable
watering place of the North of Ireland, and it is crowded
with visitors during July and August. The town is
built on a ridge that projects into the sea. The strands
are beautiful. The ridge on which the town is built
ends in a hill, called Ramore hill, which is a favorite
promenade. We could see the bathers swimming in the
surf, as we skimmed along the strand towards the White
Rocks. These are cliffs of a strange white formation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
A little beyond the White Rocks Mike slowed up, and
passed around the picturesque ruins of Dunluce Castle.
This ancient ruin crowns a high cliff, and, before men
could fly, was a difficult place to reach. Right in front
of us we could see the headlands above the Giant’s
Causeway. I did not very much enjoy my sail from
Dunluce to those headlands. After leaving the Castle,
Mike turned directly out to sea, instead of following the
coast, and crossed a bay of a few miles to the Causeway.
I remembered our experience over the river Foyle, and
I did not altogether appreciate Mike’s daring. I was
really relieved as we rose over the great cliff that over-hangs
the Causeway, and circled around with the earth
under us. We were both delighted to reach the Northern
end of the Island. It was not quite ten o’clock when we
arrived.</p>

<p>There are two large hotels on the high cliff, and
we could see the tourists, many with field glasses, watching
us in the air. Mike, in the exuberance of his joy
and self-confidence, made three great circles before
landing. In making the last circle he went out over
the sea again, and then alit beside the Railroad hotel as
lightly as a bird could have done. The crowd cheered
us as we stepped out, and some of the men came forward
to shake hands and congratulate us. We were asked
if we were the Wright Brothers, and when we said we
were not, some of them suggested Curtiss, Farnam, and
other well-known aeronauts. When we explained we
were simply tourists, using the latest and best way of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
travel, they looked at each other, and when Mike told
how we had come from Cork, they laughed outright.
I do not believe half a dozen in the crowd thought we
had come any further than from Portrush. I expect
they would not have believed we could fly at all had they
not seen us alight.</p>

<p>One Englishman laughed so contemptuously that I
noticed Mike looked at him in disgust.</p>

<p>“It reminds me of the Manager of the Chicago
Stockyards,” said the Englishman.</p>

<p>“Why, what about the Manager of the Chicago
Stockyards?” asked Mike hotly.</p>

<p>Not noticing Mike’s rising temper, the Englishman
went on to tell of a couple of Irishmen who went to
Chicago, and while there, visited the Stockyards. One
of the managers noticed the interest Erin’s sons took in
the great institution, and thought he would play a joke.
Pointing to a large herd of cattle, which were being
driven into one of the lower buildings, the Manager
called attention to them, and when the last tail had
disappeared, he waited a few moments and then pulled
a great freight elevator rope and down came a large
elevator loaded with canned meat.</p>

<p>“There,” said the Manager, slyly winking at an
employee near by, “there are all those cows you saw,
hides, horns, hoofs, and every thing, all canned and
ready for market. Did you ever see anything like that
in Ireland, Pat?” he asked.</p>

<p>Pat at once took out his note book and began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
write. The Manager looked over Pat’s shoulder and
read on Pat’s note book: “The Manager of the Chicago
Stockyards is the biggest liar I have met yet.”</p>

<p>Mike was furious as he heard the crowd join in
uproarious laughter at our expense.</p>

<p>“Do you call me a liar, sir,” said Mike, squaring
himself in front of the joking Englishman.</p>

<p>The Englishman was taken aback at Mike’s earnestness,
and, not knowing what to say, merely laughed
in a foolish kind of way.</p>

<p>“I allow no man to call me a liar,” said Mike, as he
stepped closer to his antagonist. Mike was a Yankee,
but I knew there was Irish blood in his veins, and this
rash Englishman had aroused him.</p>

<p>I was afraid our aeroplane trip was going to end in
a fiasco, when something altogether unexpected happened.</p>

<p>“I believe you, sir,” said a sweet, charming, musical
voice, “and you must tell us all about your wonderful
voyage over Ireland. It must have been delightful.”</p>

<p>Mike turned to see the speaker, and, in a moment,
every trace of anger left his face, and he stood like a
blushing schoolboy.</p>

<p>At the same time a dark-haired, rosy-cheeked girl,
of nineteen or twenty, clad in a dainty white sailor dress
and cap came forward, holding out her hand.</p>

<p>Mike recovered himself, clasped her hand, saying:
“I thank you, Miss—.”</p>

<p>“Edith O’Neill,” added the girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>“I am glad to meet you, Miss O’Neill,” said Mike,
and I never saw him look more manly.</p>

<p>The crowd burst into applause, and all was good
cheer again. That was the first meeting of Mike and
Miss O’Neill, and it was fraught with more meaning
than any of us thought at the time. I found out later
in the day that Miss O’Neill was a descendant of the
famous Irish O’Neill family. Her father was a wealthy
Dublin lawyer, and she and her parents were taking a
short holiday at the Causeway.</p>

<p>After seeing that the aeroplane was carefully stored
away in a corner of the hotel yard, Mike and I retired
to our room until lunch. Mike was in splendid humor,
and he had every reason to be. Our aeroplane trip
was a success. We had conquered the Irish air. An
Irish heiress is still more difficult to conquer, but it is
wonderful what one can do in the Irish atmosphere.</p>

both Mr. and Mrs. O’Neill, leaving Mike out in the cold
with Miss O’Neill. However, I don’t think he minded
it in the least, as both he and the fair Irish girl seemed
to get on good terms at once. I was surprised at Mike.
I had never known him before to take an interest in any

<p>After lunch Mr. O’Neill and I went for a walk
over the Causeway. Mrs. O’Neill took an afternoon
nap, and so Mike and Miss Edith were left alone together
again.</p>

<p>One reason why Mike capitulated so easily to the
charms of this fair Irish maiden was that she had been
an ardent student of aeronautics, and was even ambitious
to fly herself.</p>

<p>During the afternoon Mr. O’Neill showed me the
wonders of the Giant’s Causeway. It is no wonder that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
this unique phenomenon in geology is so far-famed. A
stream of lava, 2600 feet wide, and fifteen miles long,
instead of forming the usual basaltic rock when it had
cooled, formed itself into detached columns, from six to
thirty feet long, and from eight to twenty-four inches
in diameter. These strange columns, mostly pentagonal
or hexagonal in formation, present a smooth surface in
three parallel terraces along this Antrim coast and make
the most remarkable natural pavement ever seen by the
eyes of man. There are forty thousand of these columns,
and every one of them is a perfect geometrical figure.
The columns are so close together that water will not
pass between them, and yet each is separate.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As we walked over this marvelous piece of rock
formation, Mr. O’Neill told me the legend of Finn
McCool, and how he built the Causeway over to Scotland,
in order to provide a way for Ben Donner to come
over to Ireland to accept his challenge. Ben was the
champion of Scotland, as Finn was in Ireland, and Finn
was determined to see which was the better man. In
the contest Finn was victorious, and as there was no
further use for this strange roadway across the sea, most
of it had been swept away, but a little was left on the
Antrim coast, a relic of Finn’s remarkable handiwork.</p>

<p class="caption center">HORIZONTAL PILLARS, GIANT’S CAUSEWAY.</p>
</div>

<p>Science attempts to explain the Causeway by saying
that, when the rock was in a fluid state, crystalization
set in, and produced the phenomenon. It is claimed that
the Palisades of the Hudson are a somewhat similar
formation. On account of the fact that rocks do not
naturally crystalize, however, the Causeway still remains
the puzzle of the scientist.</p>

<p>The scenery along the coast near the Causeway is
sublime, and there is a walk along the face of the cliff,
which I found almost as dangerous as aeroplaning.
I found Mr. O’Neill a charming companion, and I
thoroughly enjoyed his society. After we had talked
of the Causeway, our conversation drifted to the subject
of Ireland’s history. Naturally, this was a subject dear
to his heart. He gave me a brief epitome of Irish
history which was new to me. Irish history begins with
St. Patrick in the fifth century of our era. St. Patrick
evangelized the Irish, and, as a result of his labors,
Ireland was the land of saints and scholars during the
period between the sixth and tenth centuries. The
Danes, who settled around the coasts of Ireland, broke
up this peaceful prosperity. Schools were demolished
and the students scattered. Brian Boru brought back
a brief period of glory to Irish history by uniting the
Irish under his able sway. He defeated the Danes in a
decisive battle at Clontarf, near Dublin, in 1014, but he
lost his life at the close of that fatal day. Ireland was
left rudderless again. The petty chiefs quarrelled
amongst themselves, and in 1170 the English came over
and claimed Ireland. The struggles of the Irish for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
political freedom have been pathetic. The native Irish
were often treated as the Indians were by the white men
in America, but with this vital exception. In America
the Indian quietly died out, and gave not trouble. In
Ireland, the Irish lived, multiplied, and filled Ireland with
Irishmen. The real estate deals made in Irish land by
several of England’s rulers left a bad taste in the mouths
of the Irish. In 1641, taking advantage of England’s
Civil War, the Irish rose against the English and Scotch
colonists in Ireland with terrible fury. In 1649 Cromwell
reduced Ireland again to English rule, treating the
natives with savage ferocity. Another rebellion arose
in 1689, when James <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> was driven from the English
throne by William <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> James came to Ireland and the
Irish rose in his favor. William <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> again conquered
the Irish. Thus the history has gone on. Laws of fearful
severity were enacted, and the native Irish, for almost
a century, were outcasts in the land of their forefathers.</p>

<p>Mr. O’Neill was a great admirer of Daniel O’Connell.
He told me that a new era began for Ireland when
Daniel O’Connell, with the assistance of English statesmen,
took off some of Ireland’s heaviest burdens. “I
believe,” said Mr. O’Neill, with great earnestness, “that
since Gladstone’s time, England has been trying to do
justice to Ireland.”</p>

<p>He assured me that the Irish had never acknowledged
that England had conquered them. He told me
about an English schoolboy who was asked to write an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
essay on the “Conquest of Ireland,” and he began: “The
Conquest of Ireland began in 1170, and is still going
on.”</p>

<p>I was much impressed with the way O’Neill recited
to me the history of his country. Sometimes tears came
into his eyes. He quoted, with much feeling, a few lines
from an Irish poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Of old the harp of Innisfail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Was turned to gladness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, Oh! how oft it’s told a tale</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of wide prevailing sadness.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He expressed high hopes that Ireland’s darkest days
are past. He believes all Irishmen in Ireland today, the
Protestant in the North and the Catholic in the South,
should blot out the unhappy memories of the past
centuries, and forget the mistakes of former times, and
face the future, united in honest efforts for Ireland’s
welfare.</p>

<p>As we walked along, while he told me all this, we
suddenly came upon Mike and Edith at the Giant’s
Wishing Chair. This is a place where the columns of
the Causeway are arranged something like a rude chair,
and it is said if you sit in this “chair,” and wish, that
your wish will come true. When we came on the scene
Edith was sitting in the chair, wishing. Mike was
standing by her side, evidently much amused.</p>

<p>“What’s your wish,” Mike asked, after we had
joined them.</p>

<p>“I wished that I might fly tomorrow,” she answered
with a blush. Then, walking up to her father she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Papa, can I take a ride in the aeroplane with
Mr. Connor tomorrow?”</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Neill glance quickly at her flushed face,
and then turn away with a sigh. She was his only child.</p>

<p>“Why, why,” he answered, “what put such a notion
as that in your head? Did you, sir?” and he looked
accusingly at Mike.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Edith, before Mike could speak,
“Mr. Connor never said a word to me about it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see tomorrow,” said her father.</p>

<p>“I think my wish will come true,” I heard Miss
O’Neill say to Mike, as they walked ahead of us up the
rough road to the hotel.</p>

<p>I did not hear Mike’s reply but it seemed to please
her immensely.</p>

<p>I resumed my talk with Mr. O’Neill about Ireland.
I asked him about recent land laws. I found him enthusiastic
about the Wyndham Act of 1903, providing
for the purchase of their farms by Irish tenants.</p>

<p>“It means a new Ireland inside a generation,” he
earnestly exclaimed. He then went on to say that the
Irish people as a whole, the native Celt, the descendants
of the Scotch, English and French, were developing
a distinctive modern Irish race, which would be able to
hold its own in every department of life. This led
him to speak of the Irish people in America, and I found
he had followed the fortunes of his countrymen across
the sea. He was delighted when I told him that Mike
and I were Irish Yankees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span></p>

<p>“County Antrim ought to be a sacred place to you,”
he said to me, “for two of your great Presidents traced
their ancestory to Antrim.” He went on to tell me that
President Jackson’s father sailed from Carrickfergus,
near Belfast, in 1765, going to North Carolina. He also
told me that the great-great-grandfather of President
McKinley emigrated from Conagher, County Antrim,
in 1743. He had himself seen the old McKinley homestead.
Mr. O’Neill and I were on such good terms of
real friendship that very evening, that I could hardly
believe it possible I had only met him that day. I believe
it was the Irish atmosphere.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Next</span>
morning at breakfast Miss O’Neill
again asked her father’s permission to ascend
in the aeroplane with Mike. I assured
him that if Mike promised to go over land
there was absolutely no danger, for, as I put it: “Mr.
Connor can alight as easily as a crow.”</p>

<p>“But what if he were to alight on a tree?” he asked
with a twinkle in his eye, which showed me that Mike
and Miss O’Neill were going to fly together all right.</p>

<p>At last, the father gave his consent, but warned
Mike not to go out over the sea. It was arranged that
they should ascend at 10:00 o’clock.</p>

<p>Mike had to make a trip to Portrush to get some
petrol, and he decided to take Miss O’Neill along with
him on that journey.</p>

<p>“Can she take such a long trip on her first flight?”
I asked, remembering my own experiences.</p>

<p>“Jack,” said Mike, confidently, “she can beat you
now as an aeronaut. She knows all about it already.
I am sure she will have no trouble.”</p>

<p>We fixed up a starting rail in the sloping field in
front of the hotel, and at 10:00 o’clock Miss Edith
and her father and mother appeared.</p>

<p>Word had gotten out about the trip and every tourist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
around the Causeway was gathered in the field to
see the ascent.</p>

<p>Edith was a perfect picture. Not having an airship
dress, she had arranged herself in closely fitting
riding habit. She made a few necessary changes, and
the dress was adapted well for her unique excursion.
She wore a blue sailor cap, matching her dress, and also
a pair of blue gloves.</p>

<p>As Mike was assisting her into the aeroplane, I
heard a lady exclaim, “What a pretty blue-bird.” I could
not help thinking that a fairer bird than Miss Edith
never flew beneath the kindly Irish skies.</p>

<p>It was a perfect day, and there was a very slight
breeze.</p>

<p>After seeing that Edith was seated, Mike vaulted
easily into his seat.</p>

<p>“All ready,” he shouted, as he started the motor.
“Good-bye,” said Edith to us all, as the aeroplane started.</p>

<p>It rose beautifully and after ascending about 75
feet, Mike circled around us. We could see Edith waving
her handkerchief. I was surprised at her composure.
After making one circle, Mike started off, like a huge
bird, for Portrush. We watched the airship until it
became a speck in the distance. Mr. and Mrs. O’Neill
walked back with me to the hotel and I had to earnestly
assure Edith’s mother that her daughter was in safe
hands.</p>

<p>Just before noon I heard a shout, “They’re coming
back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<p>I rushed out of the hotel and saw the aeroplane
about a half a mile off, bearing down on us with all
speed. When they came nearer I saw them rise, and I
knew Mike was going to circle. He went up to a height
of fully 400 feet, and circled around over the hotel
three times. In making the third circle, he went out
far over the sea.</p>

<p>The descent was made without difficulty, and the
aeroplane touched the ground without a perceptible jar.</p>

<p>Edith jumped out before Mike could descend to
help her, and before I reached the aeroplane. She ran
at once to her mother and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Edith, child,” said her mother, with tears in her
eyes, “you must not go flying again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mamma,” said the happy girl, “it was grand.
I never, never enjoyed anything like it.”</p>

<p>“You rascal,” said Mr. O’Neill, smiling, to Mike,
“I thought you promised to keep off the sea.”</p>

<p>“I made him do it,” said Edith, hastily. “He didn’t
want to, but I wanted to fly above the water.”</p>

<p>Mike hung his head. Mike was always proud of
keeping his word. It was the atmosphere again. It
changed Mike.</p>

<p>Edith cheered him by going to him with outstretched
hand, and saying in her sweet, musical voice: “Thank
you ever so much, Mr. Connor.”</p>

<p>Mike’s face brightened and he took off his cap
gallantly, saying: “The pleasure was mine, Miss O’Neill.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_093">

<p class="caption center">DUNLUCE CASTLE.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p>After Edith and her parents were gone I asked
Mike about the flight.</p>

<p>“Capital, Jack, capital,” Mike said with enthusiasm,
“I tell you Jack, there are few girls like Edith.”</p>

<p>I noticed that he had unconsciously used her first
name.</p>

<p>He then gave me some details of the flight. On
the return trip, they had paused to circle around Dunluce
Castle, and then they had followed the electric railway
to the Causeway. This electric railway from Portrush to
the Causeway was the first electric railroad that was successfully
operated in the world. It was built in 1883, being
designed by Sir William Siemens. Formerly it was
operated with the third rail, but now it is an overhead
trolley. As they were flying along this railroad, about
40 feet high, they overtook a crowded car. When the
astonished passengers saw them fly past, their enthusiasm
knew no bounds. Edith enjoyed the greeting and
waved her handkerchief in return.</p>

<p>Mike wanted to remain a few days longer at the
Causeway, but when I told him that Mr. O’Neill had
told me he was called back to Dublin the next day, and
that his family would accompany him, he decided to
start the next day himself.</p>

<p>As we bade the O’Neills goodbye, they gave us a
cordial invitation to call on them in Dublin. I was
delighted with the invitation, and so was Mike, but
for a different reason. I was glad because I knew Mr.
O’Neill would show us the places of historic interest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Ireland’s capital city, and I was anxious to see a real
Irish home. Mike confided to me that he had already
arranged to take Miss Edith for a flight over Dublin.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast we started. A big
crowd cheered us as the aeroplane rose. As we circled
around over the crowd, I could see Miss Edith’s handkerchief
waving us a farewell.</p>

<p>We sailed along the coast from the Causeway towards
Ballycastle, 13 miles away. It was as fine a
coast as I have ever seen, excepting along County Clare.
We passed over several old ruins, and saw the famous
Carrick-a-Rede Bridge. Carrick-a-Rede, which means the
Rock in the Track, is a gigantic rock, separated from
the mainland by a deep channel, sixty feet wide. Fishermen
use the rock from March to October, and a bridge
has been constructed of cables between the rock and the
mainland. This swinging bridge is fully 80 feet above
the water. As you cross it, the bridge bends and sways,
but the natives cross it continually, often carrying heavy
burdens.</p>

<p>We flew over Ballycastle, a clean-looking little
fishing village, making great excitement amongst the villagers.
It was nine o’clock when we sailed over the
town. There is coal in this vicinity, but it has been
properly worked.</p>

<p>In the distance we could see Fair Head towering
over the Sea. Near Fair Head is Torr Head, which is
only twelve and a half miles from the coast of Scotland.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
This is the shortest distance between the two countries.
We could see the Mull of Cantyre very clearly.</p>

<p>After passing Ballycastle, we flew over a surprisingly
beautiful region around Cushendal. Mike was
now taking more interest in the Irish scenery and I remarked
that he had just begun to appreciate the beauty
of Ireland. We found Glen Ariff bathed in sunshine,
its innumerable waterfalls glistening in the light of the
sunbeams. This is a place of rare beauty. As we passed
Larne we could see the excited inhabitants climbing
on the walls and roofs to get a better view of the monster
bird, as our airship looked to be from land.</p>

<p>Larne has a good harbor protected by a curious,
curving headland. Mail steamers leave here for Stranraer
across the channel, thirty-nine miles. The crossing
is made in two hours. This is the shortest crossing
between Ireland and Scotland. There is talk of running
an underground railway over to Scotland from somewhere
near here.</p>

<p>It was at Larne that Edward Bruce, a brother of
the famed Robert Bruce of Scotland, landed in 1315, in
an ill-fated expedition which he made to Ireland.</p>

<p>A little later we came to Carrickfergus, where Andrew
Jackson’s father used to live. It is ten miles from
Belfast, and in former years was a place of greater importance
than its neighbor.</p>

<p>There is an old castle at Carrickfergus, built in
1178, which still defies the ravages of time. It is built
on a huge rock, projecting thirty feet out of Belfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Lough, and is a splendid example of a Norman fortress.
There are walls in the ruins ninety feet high and nine
feet thick.</p>

<p>William <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> landed at Carrickfergus in 1690, on
his way to the Battle of the Boyne.</p>

<p>We could now see the smoke of Belfast, the Chicago
of Ireland. Overlooking it is Cave Hill, a lofty
mound, back of the city. As we swept over this great
metropolis, we rose to a height of 400 feet, so as to get
the best possible view of the busy hive of industry. Tall
chimneys sent out smoke. Huge shipyards covered
acres and acres, houses extended almost as far as the
eye could reach. Church spires pierced the sky in every
direction.</p>

<p>As I looked down on Belfast that summer morning,
it looked like a model city. Its magnificent business
streets, and noble city hall, are in keeping with its fame
and enterprise.</p>

<p>Passing directly over it, Mike brought the aeroplane
to the ground on a level place near the foot of
Cave Hill.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span>
was almost 11:00 o’clock when we alit
at the foot of Cave Hill. Leaving our airship
in charge of an astonished Irishman,
whose house was near by, we took a street
car down town, and had lunch at the Y. M. C. A. cafe.</p>

<p>Evidently our flight over the city had been observed
by many, as we heard a good deal of conversation
about the “airship.”</p>

<p>We came back to Cave Hill about noon, and I found
a great crowd around the aeroplane. Getting a starting
rail, Mike prepared to ascend as quickly as possible.
Just as we were about ready to start, I saw a young man
edge his way through the crowd, with a note book in
one hand and a pencil in the other. I recognized him
at once as a reporter, seeking an interview. Before he
came close enough to hear, I said to Mike: “Hurry up,
hurry up. I see a newspaper man.”</p>

<p>If I had told Mike I had seen his Satanic Majesty,
he could not have hurried his final preparations more,
as he has a horror of the “interviewer,” and we were
determined to escape them while in Ireland.</p>

<p>When the reporter reached my side, he began at
once: “I represent the Whig, the Belfast Whig. We
want an account of this airship, if you please. What are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
your names? Where did you come from?” Before he
could ask any more questions, Mike shouted loudly to
me: “All aboard.”</p>

<p>I was glad to leap into my seat. Without another
word, Mike vaulted into his place, started the motor,
and before the astonished reporter could get out another
word, we were sailing in the air.</p>

<p>The big crowd cheered and clapped their hands, as
we rose gracefully towards Cave Hill. Ascending to the
very summit of this hill, Mike turned the aeroplane in
one of his familiar circles, and we made another wide
sweep over Belfast. Below us we could see Belfast Castle.
The Earl of Shaftesbury, grandson of the famous
philanthropist, lives in this Castle, which is a modern
mansion, as everything is around Belfast. The Earl
has inherited some of the sterling qualities of his illustrious
grandfather, and is a public spirited citizen. He
was elected Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1907. Belfast
is a remarkable city, different from any other city in
Ireland. It practically came on the map in the 17th
century, when it first became a centre for the export
of linen in a small way.</p>

<p>As it is located at the junction of Down and Antrim
two Presbyterian Counties, Belfast has always been a
Presbyterian stronghold. There are upwards of 60
prosperous Presbyterian churches in the city today, and
the Presbyterian Assembly Hall is one of the largest
and most beautiful buildings in the North of Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<p>One hundred years ago Belfast had a population
of less than 20,000. Today it has nearly 400,000. Its
wealth has doubled six times in the last 25 years.</p>

<p>Belfast owes its prosperity to the linen trade. This
industry alone now amounts to sixty million dollars a
year. The largest mill, which I could easily distinguish,
covers five acres, with 6000 spindles, 1000 looms and
more than 4000 employees.</p>

<p>There are also extensive machine shops, and its
ship yards build the largest ocean liners afloat.</p>

<p>Here also are manufactured agricultural implements,
“soft drinks” of all kinds, and machinery of every
sort.</p>

<p>Its situation on Belfast Lough, at the mouth of the
Lagan is picturesque, and, taken altogether, Belfast is
one of the finest cities in Europe. Leaving it behind us
we sailed due south, in the direction of Downpatrick,
where St. Patrick is buried.</p>

<p>As we crossed County Down, we admired again the
thrifty farm-houses, well-tilled farms, and the little
fields, green with potatoes and turnips, or waving with
flax and oats.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour Downpatrick came in
sight. We flew over the beautiful Gothic Down Cathedral,
in the churchyard of which St. Patrick lies buried.
Here also lies buried St. Bridget and St. Columba, two
other noble characters in Ireland’s religious history.</p>

<p>St. Patrick was born in Scotland about the year
387. When he was sixteen years old, he was taken a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
captive, and sold as a slave to an Irishman, for whom he
herded sheep and swine in County Antrim.</p>

<p>While a slave, he became a devout Christian, and
made his escape when he was twenty-two years old. He
entered a monastic school in France, and fitted himself
as a Missionary to Ireland. At that time the Irish worshipped
at Druid altars.</p>

<p>Landing at the mouth of the Slaney in County
Down, he settled in Downpatrick. He remained here
several years and then visited all parts of the island,
meeting with marvelous success. In 457 he settled in
Armagh and lived there for eight years.</p>

<p>While visiting in Downpatrick in his 78th year, he
was seized with a fatal illness, and died at the scene of
early labors. Here he was buried.</p>

<p>St. Bridget was born near Armagh about 453. She
was rich and beautiful, but became a convert to Christianity,
and devoted her life to missionary labors
amongst the Irish. She died in 525, and was first buried
at Kildare. Her remains and those of St. Columba
were brought to Downpatrick in 1185. St. Patrick made
the shamrock the national flower of Ireland by teaching
from its three petals the doctrine of the Trinity.</p>

<p>Turning west from Downpatrick, Mike and I followed
in the air St. Patrick’s footsteps to Armagh. Before
entering County Armagh, we crossed over a pretty
village, called Banbridge. County Armagh resembles
County Down in its general appearance. It was a beautiful
picture of rural quietude. It was after two o’clock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
when we caught our first glimpse of the famous Irish
city of Armagh.</p>

<p>This is Ireland’s most sacred city. Two Primates
of Ireland live here, and here are two Archbishops, and
two magnificent Cathedrals. Armagh is a well-built
town of some 8,000 inhabitants. It is built partly on a
hill, which makes some of its streets quite steep. A
Cathedral was founded here by St. Patrick in 432. His
Eminence, Cardinal Logue, an able and learned divine,
is the Roman Catholic Primate, while Dr. Alexander is
the Protestant Primate of the island. The ecclesiastical
head of the Presbyterian Church is called the
Moderator, and is elected every year.</p>

<p>We sailed over the beautiful grounds of Dr. Alexander’s
Palace, and were reminded of his gifted wife,
who wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There is a green hill far away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Outside a city wall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the dear Lord was crucified,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who died to save us all.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Alexander died in 1895. Another well known
poem of hers is “The Burial of Moses.”</p>

<p>There are three prosperous and growing Presbyterian
churches in Armagh. Dr. John Hall, who afterwards
became one of the foremost preachers in America,
was pastor of one of these Presbyterian churches for a
time, and laid the foundation of his future fame in this
city. There is a vigorous Methodist church, which is
also active in promoting the Christian faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>

<p>Armagh is rich in historic memories. As I circled
over its steep and winding streets that day with Mike,
I thought of all the scenes enacted on the soil beneath.</p>

<p>Here St. Patrick lived. Here a great educational
institution flourished more than 1200 years ago. As
many as 7000 students gathered in this place at one time
to attend its far-famed University.</p>

<p>The bleeding body of Brian Boru was reverently
carried here, after the fatal day at Clontarf in 1014. In
the stirring years of the O’Neills, Armagh saw many exciting
scenes. But all was quiet and peaceful on that
lovely summer day, as we circled over the sacred city,
and flew south toward Newry.</p>

our way from Armagh to Newry, we saw
the Newry Canal. This little piece of engineering
work was completed shortly before
the railroads came to make it useless.</p>

<p>Newry is a prosperous place, but not noted much
in history. The Newryites gazed at us in wonder, as
we whirled directly over their town towards Warrenpoint.
Warrenpoint is a handsome seaside resort at the
head of Carlingford Bay. We kept to the east side of
the Bay until we reached Rosstrevor. This beautiful village
has a back-ground of wooded hills, and many handsome
villas are in its neighborhood. The village is owned
by Sir John Ross-of-Blandensburg. A large obelisk
in an elevated place tells why the name of the owner is
“Ross of Blandensburg.” This obelisk is in honor of
General Ross, grandfather of Sir John, and the inscription
reads as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;"><em>The Officers of a Grateful Army</em></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><em>Which under the command of the lamented Major General Robert Ross</em></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><em>Attacked and defeated the American forces at Blandensburg</em></span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><em> esteem for his amiable private character.</em></span><br>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<p>As I pointed out the obelisk to Mike and told him
of this inscription, he was greatly amused.</p>

<p>From Rosstrevor we crossed the little bay to Carlingford,
another picturesque village, and shortly afterwards
sighted Dundalk.</p>

<p>“What time is it?” asked Mike.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch and answered:</p>

<p>“Ten minutes to three.”</p>

<p>“Let us alight here,” said Mike. “My wings are
tired.”</p>

<p>We came down in a field just outside of the town.
It was the worst landing Mike made. We alit on one
runner of the aeroplane, and got a severe jar, but, fortunately,
no damage was done.</p>

<p>After an hour’s rest and a walk around town, we
sailed on to Drogheda, where we expected to spend the
night.</p>

<p>If we had been Theodore Roosevelt himself, or even
Edward <abbr title="the seventh">VII.</abbr>, we could not have attracted more attention
and honor from the people of the country than we
did that afternoon between Dundalk and Drogheda.
Mike made a superb landing at Drogheda. We alit beside
a two-storied house on the edge of town, creating
a sensation. Some children, near the door, saw us
swooping down, and ran, screaming into the house.
Just as we were landing a woman ran out and as she saw
the aeroplane alight, she uttered a shriek, as though she
had seen a ghost.</p>

<p>Presently a man came running, and we introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
ourselves. Leaving the aeroplane with him and the
gathering crowd, we went to a hotel. I was interested
in Drogheda, on account of its historic siege by Oliver
Cromwell in 1649. We saw two of the old towers standing,
just as they were left after the siege.</p>

<p>Oliver Cromwell is as unpopular in Ireland as the
Duke of Alva in the Netherlands, and when we read his
report of his doings at this city we were not surprised.
Here is what he wrote from Drogheda in reporting to
Parliament:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Divers of the enemy retreated to the Milmount, a
place very strong and of difficult access, being exceedingly
high, having a good graft, and strongly palisadoed.
The Governor, Sir Arthur Aston, and divers considerable
officers being there, our men getting up to them,
were ordered by me to put them all to the sword. And,
indeed, being in the heat of action, I forbade them to
spare any that were in arms in the town; and I think
that night they put to the sword about 2000 men. Then
our horse and foot followed them so fast over the bridge,
which goes over a broad river; and being very long and
houses on both sides, yet they had not time to pull up
their draw bridge, that our men fell violently upon them,
and I believe there were 2000 of them put to the sword.
Divers of the officers and soldiers being fled over the
bridge into the other parts of the town, where about 100
of them possessed St. Peters church-steeple, some the
West Gate, others a strong round tower next the gate
called St. Sundays. These being summoned to yield to
mercy refused, whereupon I ordered the steeple of St.
Peters to be fired, when one of them was heard to say in
the midst of the flames, ‘God confound me, I burn! I
burn!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>

<p>“The next day the two other towers were summoned,
in one of which was about six or seven score, but they
refused to yield themselves; and we, knowing that hunger
must compel them, set only good guards to secure
them from running away until their stomachs were come
down. From one of the said towers, notwithstanding
their condition, they killed and wounded some of our
men. When they submitted, their officers WERE
KNOCKED ON THE HEAD, and every tenth man of
the soldiers killed, and the rest shipped for the Barbadoes.”</p>
</div>

<p>After writing this gentle epistle, Oliver continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am persuaded that this is a righteous judgment
of God upon these barbarous wretches, who have embrued
their hands in so much innocent blood, and that
it will tend to prevent the effusion of blood, for the future,
which are the satisfactory grounds for such actions,
which otherwise cannot but work remorse and regret.”</p>
</div>

<p>After viewing Drogheda, we hired a jaunting car,
and visited the ruins of Monasterboice, some six miles
from town. This monastery was founded by St. Patrick.
Eight or nine centuries ago, thousands of students gathered
here every year. There are two small churches
left still standing, evidently of great age. Our driver
told us that the big round tower there was 1000 years
old. The finest relics of the past here are three large
Celtic Crosses, the largest being 27 feet in height. One
of them is badly damaged, and, of course, the damage
is attributed to Cromwell.</p>

<p>Our driver was a talkative fellow and entertained
us with all kinds of stories about the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p>“I always tell folks,” he said to Mike, “all that I
know, but begorra, I keep the rest to myself.”</p>

<p>He got a good laugh on Mike when he told us some
history which Mike deemed ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m a fool to tell me that,” said
Mike.</p>

<p>“Sure, I don’t know, sor,” answered the driver
solemnly, “I only met you this evening.”</p>

<p>This driver had a son in America, as a good many
Irish fathers have. These Irish boys go out to America
with very little that they own except their names, but
they soon begin to make remittances home, and in thousands
of Irish homes the regular remittances from faithful
sons and daughters in America are depended on as
part of the means of livelihood.</p>

<p>The river which Cromwell refers to in his dispatches,
on which Drogheda is built, is the Boyne river.
Three miles from Drogheda, on the banks of the Boyne,
the armies of William <abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> and James <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> met in battle.
This was the battle that sealed the fate of King James,
and it is said he showed a little too much anxiety for his
royal person on this occasion to win much renown as a
soldier. The battle was fought on July 12th, 1690. A
huge obelisk now marks the field of conflict.</p>

<p>The Boyne is a beautiful stream, richly wooded,
with many villas adorning its banks. This part of Ireland
is “soggy,” as Mike expressed it, with historic
memories. The next day we hoped to fly over Tara, the
ancient Capital of the Green Isle, and with pleasant anticipation,
we retired for the night.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Early</span>
next morning we ascended from
Drogheda, and followed the valley of the
Boyne for several miles. Then turning
south, we flew over County Meath, on a
straight way to Tara, the ancient Capital of Ireland.</p>

<p>County Meath is one of the most fertile spots in
Europe. Its rich greenness is proverbial. Large pasturages,
though not profitable to the peasants, add to the
beauty of the landscape.</p>

<p>“I say, Jack,” said Mike, after we had been gazing
in silence at the fields as they glided under us, “I am falling
in love with Ireland.”</p>

<p>“Mike,” I said solemnly, “you mean that you are
falling in love with the Irish. I think it is because we
are getting near Dublin you are feeling that way.”</p>

<p>“We’ll get to Dublin bright and early at this rate,”
said Mike evasively. I fancied I could see Mike become
more and more lively as we approached the neighborhood
of Dublin.</p>

<p>As we saw Tara with its little cluster of Irish cottages,
I felt a sense of disappointment, but when we circled
over the famous hill, I let my imagination supply
what was wanting. I re-peopled the green mounds with
Druid priests and Irish Kings. I imagined coronation
scenes, and vast armies filling the plains. These used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
be realities in Tara, but all is changed now. An air of
loneliness pervades the very atmosphere. Even the
“Stone of Destiny,” fabled as Jacob’s Pillow at Bethel,
is gone. It was carried to Scotland centuries ago, and
later taken to London, where it can be seen as the seat
of the coronation chair in Westminster Abbey. We saw
the Statue of St. Patrick, at which many a rude joke is
made. From our aerial viewpoint we could not see it
distinctly, but it is said to be a fair work of art for a
stone cutter to accomplish. St. Patrick often preached
at Tara, and a shaft here in his honor would be most
appropriate.</p>

<p>Daniel O’Connell on one occasion drew a quarter of
a million of people to Tara in 1844, when he held a great
two days’ political meeting and gave two brilliant addresses.</p>

<p>Tara is not marked by any marble obelisk to recount
its former glories, but it will be held in memory
while time lasts on account of Thomas Moore’s world-famed
ballad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“The Harp that once through Tara’s Halls</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">To show that she still lives.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Farewell to Tara’s Halls,” I said, as we swept on
south.</p>

<p>As we fled over Ireland we astonished the Irish
people, but we also astonished the denizens of the
air. The birds seemed unable to understand what
kind of a monster was invading their element. As we
passed over rookeries, where the crows had their nests
in large flocks, the cawing of the frightened crows was
tremendous. The little sparrows chirped around us
with their chatter. We saw many magpies, robins,
blackbirds and thrushes. There was one bird in Ireland
I learned to love, the meadow lark. It would spring
from the ground singing as it rose, until it was lost
in the clouds, but its sweet notes could still be heard.</p>

<p>Less than half an hour after leaving Tara, we arrived
at Maynooth, which is located just 12 miles west
of Dublin. Maynooth is celebrated as the seat of Maynooth
College, the chief Roman Catholic educational
center in modern Ireland. A College was established in
Maynooth as early as 1513, but the present institution
dates back only to 1795. At that time it was re-organized
and established with Government grants.</p>

<p>Three-fourths of the priests in Ireland have been
educated here, and the standard of the college is high
amongst the Catholic institutions of Europe. About<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
150 complete their education every year, and take their
place as the spiritual leaders of the Catholic population
of the Island. Until the establishment of Maynooth College,
the Irish priests were educated generally in France.
Maynooth is noted amongst all classes in Ireland as a
center for temperance reform, and it is claimed that fully
three-fourths of the priests from Maynooth are pledged
abstainers, and ardent temperance workers. The College
has a large, spacious campus, and adequate buildings,
and has an attendance of about 500 students.</p>

<p>The massive ruins of Maynooth Castle stand at the
gateway of the College. There is another interesting
ruin in the vicinity, the Round Tower, of Taghadoc, one
of the largest of these Irish Round Towers. It stands a
few miles south of Maynooth.</p>

<p>We circled twice over the College, and were greeted
with cheers by a company of the students who were
walking on the campus.</p>

<p>“Now for Dublin,” said Mike, as he turned the
aeroplane east.</p>

<p>“Mike,” I said, “do you know why every Irishman
ought to be rich?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered, “I never knew that was one of
the duties of an Irishman.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I went on, “every Irishman ought to be rich
because the capital of the country has been “dublin”
every year for centuries.”</p>

<p>“That’s a <em>capital</em> joke,” said Mike laughing.</p>

<p>As we were leaving Maynooth, I could see from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
my lofty seat the famous Carton House. In this lordly
mansion lives one of the most favored of Irishmen, the
Duke of Leinster. He has a whole bushel of titles, is
worth millions of money and has the blood of a hundred
Dukes and Earls in his veins. In spite of all this, he is
not very robust in physical health, and it is said he has
symptoms of tuberculosis. He is young and unmarried.
He has several palatial residences, but Carton House is
his favorite. It stands in a Park, enclosed by an eight
mile 10 foot wall, and in the Park are over thirty miles
of macadamized driveways. His garden covers sixty
acres. Queen Victoria was once the guest of this splendid
home, which is a royal palace itself.</p>

<p>For a number of miles we followed the river Liffey,
and it was easy to tell we were nearing the Capital City.
Beautiful villas dotted the landscape, and many of these
homes were evidently abodes of wealth and culture.</p>

<p>As we came nearer, we rose in the air until we were
fully 600 feet high. From this lofty elevation I could
see the great city of Dublin, stretching to the sea, and
reaching out on both sides along Dublin Bay. Mr.
O’Neill had described his home to us so clearly that we
had no difficulty in finding it. He lived south of Dublin,
near Blackrock, not far from the seaside.</p>

<p>We followed the river Liffey as we passed through
the center of the city. To our left we saw Phoenix
Park on the western outskirts. We passed Four Courts,
a massive Government building. We could see the
famed Dublin Castle, south of the river, and further on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Trinity College with its large campus in the middle of
the city.</p>

<p>Passing over Trinity College Park, we began to
scan the landscape for Mr. O’Neill’s residence. We
could see that we attracted great attention from the populace
and we saw thousands of upturned faces of astonished
Dublinmen. Mike’s quick eye discerned our
landing place. The home of “The” O’Neill, as we heard
him called in Dublin, was in the center of a large park,
with a tall wall circling it completely. In front of the
noble mansion there was a large lawn, which made a
good place to alight.</p>

<p>It was only nine o’clock when we dismounted from
our aeroplane at “Shaneville,” as the house was called.
Mr. O’Neill and Miss Edith came out of the large front
door, as we alit.</p>

<p>“Yankee birds, Yankee birds,” sang out the girl in
gay greeting.</p>

<p>“Welcome, gentlemen,” said Mr. O’Neill, “welcome
to ‘Shaneville’.”</p>

<p>With genuine Irish cordiality he ushered us into his
beautiful and richly-furnished home.</p>

and I were glad to rest quietly all that
day within the high walls that surrounded
“Shaneville.” Here we were safe from interviewers,
curious people, and an excited
populace.</p>

<p>When aeroplaning is as common as motoring now
is, it will be much more pleasant. Nowadays an aeroplane
makes as much excitement as a comet, and I expect
that even this record will read like a novel to some.
There are people who might enjoy the notoriety which
an aeroplane gives, but we were not anxious to get
famous in that way.</p>

<p>During our pleasant day at “Shaneville,” I renewed
my conversation with Mr. O’Neill in regard to his native
land, and, in his library that afternoon we had a
long talk again on Ireland.</p>

<p>I noticed that the coat of arms of “Shaneville” was
a red hand, with the cross of St. George, and I had remarked
that I saw that coat of arms somewhere before.
Mr. O’Neill laughed heartily, and assured me he was
confident I had seen it often. He told me that was the
coat of arms of Ulster, now, and was seen everywhere
in the North of Ireland. It was his family which gave
Ulster this sign. Long centuries before when his ancestors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
came over from Scotland to Ireland, the invaders
agreed amongst themselves that whoever touched the
shore of Ireland first with his hand would be King. An
O’Neill amongst them, when the boat stranded on the
beach, promptly drew his sharp sword, and cut off his
left hand and threw it high on the beach, and was at
once hailed as King by the rest. Since that the O’Neill
emblem has been a red hand. Mr. O’Neill related how
his family held power from that time until the beginning
of the 17th century, when a rebellion against England
cost them their power and estates in Ulster. It was at
this time that Ulster was colonized anew from Scotland.</p>

<p>James <abbr title="the first">I.</abbr> confiscated nearly all Ulster, and partitioned
out the land to new settlers, mostly from Scotland.
Although this act had meant the ruin of his house. I
could see no bitterness in O’Neill’s voice as he spoke
of this “plantation of Ulster,” as he called it. He said
that these new settlers had made good, industrious citizens,
and that Ulster was the most prosperous part of
Ireland today. He spoke highly of the character of these
Scotch-Irishmen, and added:</p>

<p>“You know, sir, away back our own people came
from Scotland.”</p>

<p>Still, I could see that O’Neill looked on these great
real estate transfers by the kings of England as wrongs
to the native Irish.</p>

<p>O’Neill told me there were three reforms going on
in Ireland in which he had hearty sympathy. These are
the improvement of Irish agriculture, the revival of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Gaelic tongue, and the suppression of intemperance
amongst the Irish people.</p>

<p>“One splendid result of the agitation for these reforms,”
he said earnestly, “is that Irishmen are beginning
to see that there is one Ireland after all. All creeds
in Ireland are united in promoting these great reforms,
and it is creating a national sentiment which is bringing
all Irishmen into sympathy with each other.”</p>

<p>“Our curse has been,” he continued, “that we have
been divided so much amongst ourselves.”</p>

<p>I was surprised when he told me of the Government’s
present efforts to improve Irish agriculture.
There is an Agricultural Department, which furnishes
instructors on such subjects as improving of crops, and
stock, butter and poultry. They also furnish seeds and
fertilizers, and are doing a great deal in promoting
prosperity in the backward parts of the island. Mr.
O’Neill was enthusiastic about the Gaelic revival.</p>

<p>“Why,” he said, “they are even teaching Gaelic now
in the National Schools of Ireland. In former times the
use of the native tongue was discouraged in every way
by the Government, but now teachers are being trained
to teach it.”</p>

<p>I suggested to him that the English was quite a useful
language, since it was spoken in America, and so
widely throughout the world.</p>

<p>“We still expect to use English, of course,” he exclaimed.
He then explained that the efforts of Douglas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Hyde and his friends were to make the Irish a bi-lingual
people, just as the Welsh are.</p>

<p>In speaking of the progress of this interesting revival
of Gaelic in Ireland he gave me some facts.</p>

<p>In 1901 as many as 638,000 could speak Gaelic in
Ireland, and the number is constantly increasing. All the
churches in Ireland, Protestant, and Catholic, have endorsed
the movement. There is a strong Gaelic League,
which employs over a dozen lecturers and organizers,
who promote the study of Gaelic all over the island. I
was assured that even in America there was a strong
branch of this Gaelic League, and Mr. O’Neill told me
that Mr. Roosevelt had endorsed the work highly.</p>

<p>O’Neill was also deeply interested in the temperance
reform.</p>

<p>“Ireland,” he said to me, “has been a place where
they have had too much good whisky and too much
bad politics. These two things have ruined us.”</p>

<p>He spoke with much pride of the fact that scientific
temperance instruction had been introduced into the
National schools of Erin in 1905, and also told of the
work that all the churches were doing. He was an ardent
admirer of Father Mathew.</p>

<p>“A real temperance apostle,” he exclaimed, “one
of God’s best blessings to Ireland since the days of St.
Patrick.”</p>

<p>He spoke cordially of the temperance leaders, and
told me of the good work being done at Maynooth college<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
by the Faculty and the students. He said that America’s
eminent churchman, Archbishop Ireland, had helped the
temperance cause in Ireland, which is his native land.
He also mentioned Rev. John Macmillan, of Belfast, the
temperance leader among the Presbyterians in Ireland,
and said he was a noble temperance patriot.</p>

<p>“These reforms,” he repeated, “are bringing us together
and giving a feeling of unity to Irishmen such
as they have not had since the days of Brian Boru.”</p>

<p>I asked him what he thought of Ireland’s relation to
England.</p>

<p>He paused a few moments before answering, and
when he did reply it was in a low, quiet tone.</p>

<p>“We must forget the past,” he said, “if Ireland is
to make progress. It is true that England has cruelly
wronged Ireland. My own family has suffered in past
generations, suffered shamefully. But the English
Government of today is treating Ireland very differently.
Gladstone inaugurated a new era, through the
efforts of Parnell, Redmond, and our modern Irish
leaders. Today the English people, I believe, want Ireland
to have justice.”</p>

<p>I asked him what he thought of separation from
England. He answered at once: “We cannot be separated.
God has placed the islands side by side. What we
want is freedom to manage internal affairs, just as the
States in America, just as Canada, Australia, and New
Zealand. We want local-self government, but we must
remain a part of the British Empire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>

<p>He went on to tell me how the Irishmen had helped
to build up the British Empire, and make it what it is
today.</p>

<p>“The present ambassador of the British Empire in
Washington,” he exclaimed, “is an Irishman.”</p>

<p>I was profoundly impressed with his views on this
subject. I could see he was a man with wide sympathy
and practical outlook, and believed in living for the future,
rather than the past. He still had all the fire of
the O’Neill blood in his veins, but it had been disciplined
by generations of suffering.</p>

<p>We had a happy time in the evening. There is no
hospitality like the Irish hospitality. It is whole-hearted,
cordial and sincere.</p>

<p>Miss Edith delighted us with several Irish songs.
She sang Moore’s touching melody: “The Last Rose of
Summer,” with genuine pathos. Afterwards she began
on American songs, and when she had sung several, I
remarked that she sang like an American.</p>

<p>She turned around on her piano stool and replied:
“I have always admired America. Sometimes I tell my
father that I believe that I was meant for an American
woman.”</p>

<p>“Cross the ocean, Miss O’Neill,” said Mike quickly,
“and a thousand Americans will swear that you were
meant for an American man.”</p>

<p>Edith blushed and turned again to the piano.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” said Mr. O’Neill to Mike, “you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
been kissing the Blarney Stone since you came to Ireland.”</p>

<p>“It’s the atmosphere,” I remarked, “Mr. Connor
gets more like an Irishman every day.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear what the citizens of Dublin did
when the Union of 1801 was agitated?” asked Mr.
O’Neill. “They held an indignation meeting, and resolved
to burn everything that was imported from England,
except <em>coal</em>.” As we laughed heartily at this, Mr.
O’Neill went on: “Our coachman made a curious remark
to me today about you gentlemen and your aeroplane.
He said you ought to feel proud of this trip you
are making over Ireland in the air, for you are going
<em>where the foot of man never trod before</em>.”</p>

<p>“This coachman amused me shortly after I first
hired him. There is a bad hole back of the stable, and
I forgot to say anything to him about it until I found
he had fallen into it, and hurt himself severely. I told
him I was sorry I had forgotten to tell him about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Master,” he replied, “I found it
myself.”</p>

<p class="center">AROUND THE CAPITAL CITY OF IRELAND</p>


<div>
<img alt="T" class="drop-cap" height="70" src="images/i_125.jpg" width="70">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span>
next morning after breakfast, Mr.
O’Neill drove his motor car in front of the
house, and Miss O’Neill, Mike and I joined
him for a day around Dublin.</p>

<p>I took my seat beside Mr. O’Neill, and Mike and
Edith sat together in the rear.</p>

<p>We had a delightful day, and the memory of that
trip around this interesting city will always be one of
my happiest memories.</p>

<p>Our first visit was Trinity College, with its campus
of 47 acres in the heart of Dublin. The main building,
at the entrance, is a noble structure. We entered Examination
Hall, where many an Irish brain has been violently
cudgelled at examination time. There is a fine
portrait hung on its walls of Queen Elizabeth, who
founded Trinity. The chapel is a modest building. The
Library is famed as containing Brian Boru’s harp. It is
said that this harp suggested to Moore his ode on Tara.
Here we also saw the “Book of Kells”, so called because
it came from the Monastery at Kells.</p>

<p>In this book the four gospels are written out with
exquisite penmanship, on leaves embossed with gold,
and beautifully illuminated. We doubt if there is a
more beautiful book in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>

<p>Coming out of Trinity, Mr. O’Neill called our attention
to the statues of Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith,
which adorn the entrance. These are two of the
most famous of Trinity’s sons.</p>

<p>Opposite the entrance to Trinity is the old Parliament
House, in which in former days the Irish Parliament
met. It is now used by the bank of Ireland. It
was in this building that Grattan thundered his anathemas
against the foes of Ireland.</p>

<p>Dublin is a city of monuments. As Mr. O’Neill
showed them to us, we began to have a better appreciation
of the number of eminent men whom Ireland has
given to the world.</p>

<p>High above them all, in the centre of the city, is
a lofty pillar, 134 feet high, erected to the honor of the
great English Admiral, Lord Nelson. From the base of
Nelson’s monument street cars start in all directions.</p>

<p>Daniel O’Connell’s monument is a fitting tribute
to Ireland’s great Liberator. It is 12 feet high and is
surrounded by a number of smaller figures. There are
also statues of the two great Irish Statesmen, remarkable
for their patriotic eloquence, Henry Grattan, and
John Philpot Curran.</p>

<p>Mr. O’Neill also pointed out the statue to Father
Mathew, which stands in a central place. It is a noble
work of art, done in marble, and is worthy of the Apostle
of Temperance. Thomas Moore, the gifted poet, has
been honored by his countrymen also, although his
poems will keep his memory green as long as time lasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p>A statue to Charles Stewart Parnell is to be erected
Mr. O’Neill told us. O’Neill has been a great admirer
of Parnell, and the tragic close of his life grieved him
much.</p>

<p>We had a delightful time in Phoenix Park. This
unrivalled combination of forest and meadow, flowerbeds
and fountains, driveways and lawns, covers 1700
acres, and is a credit to Ireland.</p>

<p>There is a statue of the Duke of Wellington, Ireland’s
foremost soldier, in Phoenix Park. It is like
Washington’s Monument in Washington, except that it
is only one-third as large.</p>

<p>We visited the zoological gardens in the Park.
Here we saw a marvelous collection of all kinds of animals.</p>

<p>As we went through the Monkey house, Mike said
to Edith: “In America some wise men think we sprang
from monkeys.”</p>

<p>“The Irish didn’t,” she said gaily, “we never <em>sprang
from anybody</em>. We sprang at them.”</p>

<p>As we laughed at her wit, Mike remarked:</p>

<p>“I have always objected to having a monkey tied
on to my family tree.”</p>

<p>Mr. O’Neill took us to the Viceregal lodge, which
is in Phoenix Park, where the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland
lives in the summer time, and we had a brief audience
with His Excellency. He professed to be much
pleased to see us, and was greatly interested in our
aerial exploits in the Irish atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<p>We also visited Dublin Castle, the center of Irish
history for centuries. We saw there the tower in which
Robert Emmet and Lord Edward Fitzgerald were confined,
over a century ago, after their ill-fated rebellions.
Oliver Cromwell resided in this castle for a time. William
<abbr title="the third">III.</abbr> visited it in 1690. The Castle is at present the
scene of many gay social events during the winter
months, when the Lord Lieutenant resides in it.</p>

<p>Stephen’s Green is an aristocratic suburb of twenty-two
acres in the heart of Dublin. It is a big square, surrounded
by the mansions of the rich and titled of Dublin’s
citizenship.</p>

<p>We motored also a little to the south of Dublin
and visited Clontarf, where the famous battle was fought
on Good Friday in 1014 between the Irish and the
Danes. In this battle Brian Boru was killed. Brian
marched his army that day from Phoenix Park, where
he was encamped, and defeated the Danes, but one of the
fleeing Danish generals slew the aged Brian.</p>

<p>There are two famed Cathedrals in Dublin. St.
Patrick’s Cathedral, where Dean Swift formerly preached,
is a fine cruciform church, in the early pointed
style. In it there are monuments to both the Dean and
“Stella” his wife. This Cathedral was founded in 1190
but had varied experiences in history. It was “restored”
in 1865, at a cost of over $800,000, by Sir Benjamin
Guinness.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Pro-Cathedral is in Marlborough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
Street, and is built in Doric style. The magnificent
altar is of white marble. The music in the services is
especially fine.</p>

<p>We planned to leave Dublin the first of the next
week and continue our way southward. We spent a
quiet Sunday at “Shaneville” attending divine services
with the O’Neills.</p>

<p>The next morning Edith obtained permission from
her father and mother to take her much anticipated flight
over Dublin. The ascent was made at ten o’clock.
Edith was dressed in a neat-fitting white dress, with
white gloves and veil to match, when she appeared on
the lawn, ready to start. She looked so charming as she
seated herself in the aeroplane, that I could not help
exclaiming.</p>

<p>“These Irish birds are rare creatures.”</p>

<p>“Watch the Irish dove and the American Eagle
soar,” said Mike, as he started the motor. We waved
goodbye as the aeroplane rose in the air, and disappeared
over the trees.</p>

<p>While they were gone Mr. O’Neill took me for a
final stroll over his pleasant grounds.</p>

<p>“I have never visited America,” he told me, “but
I am anxious to cross the Atlantic, and see your marvelous
country. America holds the future.” He expressed
high admiration for the leaders in America, especially
President Roosevelt and William Jennings Bryan.</p>

<p>“I met Mr. Bryan a few years ago here in Dublin,”
he said. “We were all delighted with him. He is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
great and good man. He told me there was Irish blood
in his veins and he was proud of it.” Mr. O’Neill also
expressed the highest admiration for Abraham Lincoln,
and called him a benefactor to all the world.</p>

<p>I cordially invited him to visit the land of the Stars
and Stripes.</p>

<p>In half an hour Edith and Mike returned. Mike
circled over the house, in his usual way before alighting
and then made a good landing just where he had started
from.</p>

<p>With her face flushed and happy, Edith stepped
lightly to the grass.</p>

<p>“Papa, papa,” she cried, as Mr. O’Neill came forward
to greet her, “You must get an aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“My child,” said her fond parent, “I am afraid this
old bird has walked too long to learn to fly now.”</p>

<p>“What did you see?” I asked.</p>

<p>“O, everything,” she answered, “it was grand. We
went away out as far as the Golf Grounds at Malahide,
and all over Phoenix Park. Won’t you come back
again Mr. Connor,” she said, turning to Mike who was
standing beside his airship.</p>

<p>Mike took off his cap and bowed.</p>

<p>“I surely will,” he said so emphatically, that the
color came to Edith’s cheeks.</p>

<p>As I looked at them, already such cordial friends,
and realized that they had never met until a few days
before, I said to myself:</p>

<p>“It’s the Irish atmosphere.”</p>

<p class="center">WICKLOW, THE GARDEN OF IRELAND</p>


<div>
<img alt="A" class="drop-cap" height="72" src="images/i_131.jpg" width="70">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">After</span>
dinner that day we bade our friends
farewell. Mr. and Mrs. O’Neill were urgent
in their invitation that we visit them again.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” said Edith to Mike. “I am
very glad I have met you, and I thank you for the pleasure
of flying with you.”</p>

<p>“Do not mention it,” said Mike as he held her hand,
“You are such a brave aeronaut that I could fly with you
anywhere.”</p>

<p>Edith blushed deeply as Mike’s eyes spoke as well
as his tongue.</p>

<p>After we had ascended in the air, Mike circled
around, like a carrier pigeon, and then sped off toward
the south.</p>

<p>As we entered County Wicklow, we left the seacoast
and crossed Wicklow about the middle of the
County, passing over the Wicklow hills.</p>

<p>This was the most exciting part of our entire trip.</p>

<p>Wicklow has been called a miniature Switzerland,
and it well deserves the name. There are over twenty
mountains in this small space that exceed 2000 feet
in height, and as they rise abruptly from the level, they
seem even higher.</p>

<p>Scattered among these hills, there are beautiful valleys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
magnificent mansions, villas, farms and Irish cottages.
Much of the country is thickly wooded. The
Woods of Shillelah are in Wicklow. Here the best
blackthorn, out of which Ireland’s ancient weapon was
made, used to grow, and the weapons were called “Shillelahs”
from these woods.</p>

<p>In order to see the grandeur of Wicklow to the best
advantage, Mike and I threw discretion to the winds.
The motor had been acting so well since we left County
Derry, that we had full confidence in it now.</p>

<p>“Let us go over the tops of the mountains,” I said to
Mike.</p>

<p>He was glad to do this, and rose until we reached
the dizzy height of 2500 feet. I would not advise aeroplanists
to seek this altitude until they are thoroughly acclimated
to life in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>I had become somewhat hardened to aeroplaning,
but as I looked straight down sometimes into a deep
valley, half a mile below me, I did not feel altogether
at my ease.</p>

<p>The view was magnificent. We passed over the
Valley of Glendalough, between the mountains of Coomaderry
and Lugduff. In this dark valley, by the side of
a lake, St. Kevin lived in an early day. His fear of
womankind has been immortalized by Moore. Formerly
in this valley there was a crowded city, and a great seat
of learning, and many kings are buried in this vicinity.</p>

<p>We saw here the ruins of the Seven Churches, and
a Round Tower, said to date back to the 7th century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span></p>

<p>As we entered the vale of Avoca, I remarked to
Mike that Thomas Moore had touched Ireland with his
genius, just as Sir Walter Scott threw a charm over
Scotland. The vale of Avoca is best known by Moore’s
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sweet Vale of Avoca, how calm could I rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In thy bosom of shade, with friends I love best;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where the storms that we feel in this cold world should cease,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And our hearts, like thy waters, be mingled in peace.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Although the scenery through Wicklow was grand,
I felt relieved as we quitted our lofty altitude, and sailed
nearer the earth over the more prosaic County of Wexford.
As Mike lowered the aeroplane within about
100 feet of the land I breathed easier.</p>

<p>Wexford was the home of Dermot McMurragh,
who first invited the English into Ireland. The ruins of
his castle and his tomb are near Ferns, but Wexford is
not particularly proud of McMurragh.</p>

<p>Wexford has been called by an Irishman, “the most
agricultural county in Ireland,” and we could well believe
it as we swept over its green pastures and cultivated
farms.</p>

<p>We sighted the city of Wexford at 4:00 o’clock. As
we circled around over the city, I observed its excellent
harbor, with a complete breakwater, and also its spacious
docks. The city looks like a city in Palestine on account
of its narrow streets, but it is a clean, prosperous looking
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>

<p>We alit, as usual outside the city, and left our aeroplane
for the night in charge of a friendly farmer. We
made our escape as quietly as possible from the gathering
crowd, and soon found the quiet of a good hotel.
The Redmond family, noted Irish leaders, reside in
Wexford, and the spirit of the dislike to England is very
pronounced.</p>

<p>We saw two magnificent churches called the Twins,
on account of their similarity. These show the religious
zeal of the people. The business part of the town showed
their commercial enterprise.</p>

<p>The Quay is a busy place as steamship lines run to
England, and there is much traffic in merchandise between
Wexford and England, but there is none in affection.</p>

<p>Before retiring for the night we met an interesting
old Irishman, whose whole soul was controlled by hatred
of Cromwell and England. He had none of Mr. O’Neill’s
charity for ancient wrongs, and, as he told us of Cromwell’s
Wexford campaign, we could sympathize with him
a good deal. To show us how Ireland regarded Cromwell,
he quoted from an Irish poet, a few lines, which
ran something like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From Drogheda that man of guilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To fated Wexford flew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The red blood reeking on his hilt</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of hearts to Erin true.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He found them there—the young, the old,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The maiden and the wife;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their guardians brave in death were cold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who dared for them in strife.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They prayed for mercy, God on high</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Before Thy Cross they prayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ruthless Cromwell bade them die</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To glut the Saxon blade.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After a while we turned the old patriot’s attention
to America, and we found he had a deep interest in the
New World. “It’s God’s country over there,” he told
us. We found he had friends in America, and he gave
us a ludicrous verse in which some Irishman had described
the American character.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He’d kiss a Queen till he’d raise a blister,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With his arms round her neck, and old felt hat on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And address a King by the name of Mister,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And ask him the price of the throne he sat on.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mike and I assured him that the Irish poet was too
severe on the Yankee.</p>

<p>“Tell us a good Irish story,” I said, before we
separated.</p>

<p>“I will that,” he said, and he told us this one.</p>

<p>An excited orator during the American Civil War,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“We have taken Atlanta: we have taken Savannah,
Columbus, Charleston, and now at last, have captured
Petersburg, and occupy Richmond: and what remains
for us to take?”</p>

<p>An Irishman in the crowd shouted: “Let’s take a
drink.”</p>

<p>As he closed the story our genial friend pointed towards
the bar of the hotel in a significant way, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
saw the direction of his joke. We declined politely to
show our friendship in this way, but we bade him good-night
with a warm handshake and best wishes for the
good of Ireland.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span>
left Wexford the next morning in a misty
rain.</p>

<p>“I am glad I put a rain-coat on my aeroplane,”
said Mike as the rain came down in
a regular pour.</p>

<p>We did not enjoy that morning’s sail from Wexford
to Waterford. In an hour’s time we saw Waterford arise
out of the mist. Like Wexford, Waterford is an important
seaport, built on the banks of the Suir river. The
name of this beautiful river is a vile slander. Much agricultural
produce, and bacon and live stock are shipped
from here to England.</p>

<p>The city was able to defend itself against Cromwell
in 1649, and was the only place in Ireland that did not
fall before the terrible charge of Cromwell’s Ironsides.</p>

<p>I was able to see, though indistinctly, the Cathedral,
where Strongbow, Ireland’s first English master, lies
buried. This arch-enemy of Ireland is surely well buried
as he has also a tomb in Dublin. Strongbow married the
daughter of Dermot McMurragh on the battle field near
Waterford where he defeated the Irish.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts has a home in Waterford, and it was
here he grew up and developed those fighting qualities
which have made him England’s foremost soldier today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>Waterford was founded by the Danes in the ninth
century. The antique iron bridge across the river, and
the docks, a mile long, are notable features of the modern
city.</p>

<p>There is one interesting relic of the Danish period
still standing near the docks. It is a large round tower,
about 50 feet high, which was built by Reginald, the
Dane, in 1003. At present it is a police cell.</p>

<p>We left Waterford with the rain still falling, and
went up along the banks of the Suir to Portlaw, a small
manufacturing town. Near here we flew over Curraghmore,
the stately mansion of the Marquis of Waterford.
The desmesne covers 5000 acres, and is a beautiful natural
park, with many slopes, and dells. There is an
ancient castle beside the modern mansion.</p>

<p>In this part of Ireland Sir Walter Raleigh and Edmund
Spencer lived. We soon saw Youghal, on the
coast, where Raleigh lived, and where his old house still
stands.</p>

<p>Edmund Spencer was a close friend of Raleigh’s.
He was an English poet but became associated with Ireland
because he wrote the “Fairy Queen in the Emerald
Isle” in 1589 and 1590. He would be more popular in
Ireland today only, unfortunately, the Maiden Queen
Elizabeth gave him a present of some 3028 acres of Irish
land. The Queen’s title to this piece of real estate was
not considered very good by the Irish, and they have
never forgiven Spencer for accepting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span></p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh also accepted a big farm of over
40,000 acres in Ireland from this same Maiden Queen,
whose real estate transactions in Ireland were considerable,
but Raleigh has been partly forgiven because he
gave Ireland the potato.</p>

<p>It was nearly nine when we whizzed over Youghal,
and circled around it twice. We dipped, as we flew
over the harbor, until we were within thirty feet of the
water, and aroused excited cheering from the crowd
watching us on the docks, as we turned and rose high
again over the city.</p>

<p>I discovered Myrtle Lodge, Raleigh’s old home in
Youghal. It was ivy clad, and well preserved, and the
grounds around it neatly kept. I was delighted to see
the garden of Myrtle Lodge. It is almost as sacred to
the Irishman as the Garden of Eden. In this garden in
1586 Sir Walter Raleigh planted the first potato ever
grown in the Emerald Isle. He brought the seed from
the West Indies, where they had been carried by the
Spanish from Peru, the potato’s native home.</p>

<p>It was a century after this before the sterling qualities
of the potato were appreciated fully, but now that
useful tuber is adopted as Ireland’s own darling vegetable.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Raleigh was quite a gardener, as well
as having a reputation as a soldier, an author, a courtier,
an explorer, a statesman, and a lover. In some respects
he was the Theodore Roosevelt of his age. Doubtless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
he inherited his genius for gardening from his first parent,
Adam. He brought the seed of the cherry from the
Azores, and planted the first cherry tree in this famous
garden, as it is said all the cherries in the United Kingdom
can trace their descent back to Youghal.</p>

<p>We were now only thirty miles from Cork. As we
left Youghal, and the landing place of the potato in Ireland,
the heavy clouds suddenly made up their minds
to decamp. They at once scattered in all directions, and
in fifteen minutes the sun was shining just as though it
had been with us all morning. Then it was that it
occurred to us that the sudden changes of Irish weather
were not always a disadvantage. If it rains easy, it also
clears away easy.</p>

<p>I was glad to see the fields of Cork again. We followed
the railroad line most of the way from Youghal
to Cork. We met a train again on this road, and had
another noisy greeting from the engine and passenger
coaches.</p>

<p>As we neared Cork, and saw the magnificent Cork
Harbor, stretching down to Queenstown, I turned to
Mike and said:</p>

<p>“Mike, Ireland is a great country, and you and I
have seen it the last few days as nobody has ever seen it
before. The aeroplane will give to Ireland a new fame
throughout the world.”</p>

<p>“We have had a big time,” said Mike simply, but
I knew he was the happiest man on earth, or rather in
the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>As we were circling around preparatory to making
a landing, I repeated enthusiastically the words of an
Irish poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O Ireland, isn’t it grand you look:</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Like a bride in her rich adornin’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with all the pent-up love of my heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">I bid you the top o’ the mornin’.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We landed at 10:00 o’clock on the very field we had
left only a few days before.</p>

<p>If Columbus, when he set foot on America, felt any
bigger than we did as we stepped out of our aeroplane at
Cork that day, he must have felt bigger than Goliath.</p>

<p class="center">OUR LAST DAY IN IRELAND SEEING TIPPERARY</p>

<div>
<img alt="W" class="drop-cap" height="71" src="images/i_144.jpg" width="70">
</div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span>
spent the rest of that day around Cork.
Going to the steamship office we found our
liner would call at Queenstown on the second
day. We had one more day for sightseeing.</p>

<p>“Mike,” said I, “let us start early tomorrow morning,
and spend our last day seeing Tipperary.”</p>

<p>“Agreed,” said he.</p>

<p>He carefully overhauled the motor, and we had all
in readiness for a second flight from Cork the next
morning.</p>

<p>We flew direct toward County Tipperary. Our
first place of interest was Cashel, the former Capital of
Munster.</p>

<p>As we entered Tipperary and skimmed over its
green acres, I entertained Mike by quoting to him a description
of a Tipperary man:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Strong is his form, his heart is warm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">His spirit light as any fairy:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His wrath as fearful as the storms</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">That sweep the hills of Tipperary.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lead him to fight for Fatherland,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">His is no courage cold or wary;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The troops live not on earth could stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">The headlong charge of Tipperary.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But meet him in his cabin rude,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Or walking with his dark-haired Mary,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’d swear they knew no other mood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">But mirth and love in Tipperary.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span></p>
<p>When I had finished, Mike returned me the favor by
singing, with the motor as an accompaniment, a famous
Tipperary song. The words of it are:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, Paddy, dear, and did you hear the news that’s going round?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The shamrock is by law forbid to grow on Irish ground;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No more St. Patrick’s Day we’ll keep, his color can’t be seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For there’s a bloody law agin the wearin’ o’ the green.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I met with Napper Tandy, and he tuk me by the hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he said, ‘And how’s ould Ireland and how does she stand?’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She’s the most distressful country that ever yet was seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For they’re hangin’ men and women for the wearin’ o’ the green.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When he had finished I said:</p>

<p>“Mike, an Irishman could not sing that any better
than you.”</p>

<p>“An Irishwoman could, though,” said Mike, and
then he continued, “You ought to have heard Edith sing
that very song as we were flying over Dublin. I thought
I was in heaven, and was hearing the angels sing.”</p>

<p>“When you landed after that trip you both looked
as though you had been in the seventh heaven,” I answered.</p>

<p>Just then we sighted the rock of Cashel, and our
thoughts were turned into other channels. Cashel, like
Tara, is only a memory. Formerly it was a place of the
greatest importance all over the south of Ireland. Now
it is an unimportant village. The famous rock of Cashel
still stands, crowned with the ruins of the old Cathedral,
King Cormac’s Chapel, and a Round Tower. This celebrated
rock is a mass of limestone, rising steeply out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the plain to the height of 300 feet. Here formerly the
Kings of Munster were crowned, and here, in 1172, Henry
<abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> was declared King of Ireland. St. Patrick preached
at Cashel when it was a Royal Court.</p>

<p>We circled the Rock twice to the utter amazement
of the inhabitants of the village. I doubt if we made
more stir anywhere than in Cashel.</p>

<p>Passing on towards Thurles, we saw one of the
finest monastic ruins in Ireland, Holy Cross Abbey. The
ruins are of great antiquity, but are well preserved, and
they are quite extensive. The Cruciform church is still
extant enough to show lines of great beauty. This was
a former Sanctuary of the O’Briens of Limerick.</p>

<p>From Thurles we went directly west to Limerick.</p>

<p>Limerick is one of Ireland’s oldest cities, and it
looks it. It is built on the Shannon river, and Limerick
Castle still frowns over that noble stream. This old
castle is well preserved.</p>

<p>Limerick, like so many of the towns around the
coast of Ireland, was founded by the Danes. It has been
the scene of some stirring Irish history. Two famous
sieges were endured by this city in the 17th century.</p>

<p>In 1651, the English besieged and captured Limerick
under General Ireton. On capturing the city, Ireton
hung Bishop O’Brien, an outrage deeply resented by the
Irish people.</p>

<p>In 1690 the forces of William <abbr title="the second">II.</abbr> invested Limerick,
after the victory at the Boyne, and the garrison was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
compelled to capitulate. The treaty of capitulation was
signed on a large stone, since called the “Treaty Stone.”</p>

<p>This Treaty afterwards was shamefully violated by
the English Government, and to this day Limerick is
known in Ireland as “The City of the Violated Treaty.”
As we flew over the city I saw this famous stone, on a
pedestal, near Thomond Bridge. I also saw the ancient
Cathedral which adorns the city. The present population
of Limerick is only 40,000 as the city has lost heavily
in recent years by emigration to America. The chief
business at present is butter-making, but lace and linen
are also produced. There are fine docks and a good export
business, as the Shannon is easily navigable at
Limerick.</p>

<p>There was one other spot in Ireland we wished to
see. We could not finish up our aeroplane trip without
flying over Glengariff, which has been called the loveliest
spot in all Europe. We made a rapid return flight from
Limerick to County Cork. We sped past the Kerry
Mountains, beyond which lay Killarney, but we did not
attempt to cross them. It was still early in the forenoon
when we reached Bantry Bay.</p>

<p>Glengariff means “Rugged Glen” and the scenery
is rugged enough in places but it is undoubtedly one of
the finest scenes in the world. A mountain stream runs
through the lovely valley, which is crossed by many
picturesque bridges, before it empties itself into the
waters of Bantry Bay. Thackery said if Glengariff were
in England, it would be one of the world’s wonders.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
The climate is remarkably mild all the year and the wild
flowers grow in profusion. We passed directly over
the little village of Glengariff, and saw Cromwell’s
Bridge. This is a bridge said to have been damaged, as
so much else was during Cromwell’s visit in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Our minds, our hearts, our souls were full of the
beautiful scenes of the Emerald Isle, when we turned towards
Cork for our final flight.</p>

<p>Before we reached the more level land, beyond the
hills of Bantry Bay, we had one of our worst experiences
with the aeroplane. While crossing a very broken, and
hilly stretch of country, covered with stone fences, small
cabins, and mountain garden patches, without any warning,
the motor again stopped suddenly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_149">
<img src="images/i_149.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="310">
<p class="caption center">“BEGORRA, IT’S A FOINE BURD.”</p>
</div>

<p>I cried out to Mike to land at once. He was compelled
to alight, for, when the motor is dead, an aeroplane
is like a bird with two broken wings. With the
rocky ground, stone fences, and little garden-patches, it
was the most difficult descent Mike had to make. He
saved the aeroplane from a smash-up only by lighting
squarely on the roof of one of the little thatched cabins.
As we landed on it, a man, his wife and several children
rushed out and gazed at us in silent wonder. We climbed
down as best we could, and explained our plight. While
the man went away to get some of his neighbors to
assist us in getting the aeroplane down on the ground,
I looked the cabin over. It was not a beautiful sight
when seen close at hand. A vile-smelling manure pile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>was heaped in front of the door, and the rude stone walls
were most unsightly. The thatch looked as ancient as
some of the old ruins we had lately seen. The cabin had
only one room. Chickens ran in and out along with the
children, and as I entered inside, I saw “the pig in the
parlor,” for the one room was the kitchen, dining room,
parlor and bed-room combined. Part of the cooking was
done outside during fair weather, and a pot of potatoes
were boiling over a peat fire beside the cottage. There
was a baby in the mother’s arms, and I counted six other
children around her. Pallets of straw showed where the
nightly rest was obtained. The floor was nothing but
hard mother earth. A table, two rough chairs, and a
stool, with a rough cupboard completed the furnishings.
A few pots lay near the peat fire under the hole, which
was meant for a chimney. There was no window. The
one door furnished all the light and air.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I found out afterwards that such cabins were occupied
only by a comparatively few, even of the poor in
Ireland. The Government is at present working among
these poor peasants, and in a few years it is expected
such hovels will be banished forever from the island.
This was a “bog-trotter” cabin, such as is only found in
the hilly and desolate regions, where birds, to say nothing
of men, find it hard to get a living.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The woman was cordial and self-possessed, and did
not seem to mind the squalid surroundings. She offered
us some of the cooked potatoes, and as we ate them outside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the cabin, taking them in our hands, they tasted as
good as though they had been cooked in a palace.</p>

<p>A few neighbors soon gathered and helped us get
the aeroplane down from the low roof.</p>

<p>While Mike was getting ready to start again, I
talked with the owner of the cabin. He seemed cheerful
and pointed out to me his potato patch, his “food and
drink.”</p>

<p>He told me about the mountains that could be seen
from his cabin, and named several of the more important
hills. I noticed that a number of the names had the
“devil” in them. One peak he called the “devil’s
Needle.” Another hill, with a hollow place in its side
was the “devil’s Bit.” I thought I would see if there was
any Irish in him, and I said:</p>

<p>“His Satanic Majesty seems to own a great deal of
property among these hills, judging by their names.”</p>

<p>“Indade he does, sor,” said this son of Erin, “but he
is like most of our landlords, he makes his headquarters
in London, sor.”</p>

<p>I saw it was no difference where you find him, in
palace, mansion, villa, cottage, cabin or even hovel, an
Irishman is always the same. Everywhere you will find
him genial, witty, good-natured. It must be the effect
of the Irish atmosphere.</p>

<p>When Mike had the motor going again we soon
made our ascent aloft, leaving our Irish cabiners watching
us in awe.</p>

<p>We reached Cork again shortly after noon. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
a brief rest, we spent the rest of the day in taking the airship
to pieces, and re-packing it.</p>

<p>Next morning we were ready for our ocean voyage
and took the early train from Cork to Queenstown.
Five days later we reached New York. We had been
absent considerably less than a month.</p>

<p>Mike has since returned to Ireland. He did not take
the aeroplane, but he took along a big trunk. When he
returns, as he will in a few weeks, the Connor house in
New York State, will have a beautiful young Irish girl
as its queen, and my good friend, Mr. O’Neill will come
out to America next year to see his daughter, Mrs. Michael
Connor. Such was the strange ending of our aeroplane
trip. As I think of it, I often say to myself: “It
was the result of the Irish atmosphere.”
